An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal \\\\norders suppression of the Tenant name and identifying details.\\\\n\\\\n2. Daniel Hannibal and Warwick John Kiely must pay [The tenant/s] $4,820.44 \\\\nimmediately, calculated as shown in table below:\\\\n\\\\nDescription Landlord Tenant\\\\nRent arrears $50.00  \\\\nFiling fee reimbursement  $20.44\\\\nExemplary damages: Failure  to lodge bond  $250.00\\\\nRefund bond  $2,800.00\\\\nExemplary damages: HHS breach  $1,800.00\\\\nTotal award $50.00 $4,870.44\\\\nNet award  $4,820.44\\\\nTotal payable by Landlord to Tenant  $4,820.44\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4546673 2\\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. All the parties attended the hearing. The tenant appeared with a support person.\\\\n\\\\n2. The owner, Mr Kiely, purchased the property in August 2022 and agreed to rent \\\\nit to Mr Hannibal and his partner\\\\n\\\\n3. For the clarity I will refer to  Mr Kiely as the owner, Mr Hannibal as the landlord \\\\nand  [The tenant/s], as the tenant.\\\\n\\\\n4. The owner was not sure at the time of purchase if the premises complied with the \\\\nResidential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) 2019 (HHS) due to its age, \\\\nbeing 50 years old, and because he had not inspected it before renting it out. \\\\n\\\\n5. The premises are a 4-bedroom house with 10 acres of land and shedding. The \\\\nlandlord then signed a tenancy agreement with the tenant renting out the house. \\\\nThe owner consented to this. The landlord continued to rent the balance of the  \\\\nland and sheds for his stock off the owner. \\\\n\\\\n6. The tenancy agreement listed Mr Hannibal as the ‘landlord’ and [The tenant/s] as \\\\nthe ‘tenant’. The start date of this tenancy was 5 November 2022. The tenant \\\\nreceived support for the tenancy through WINZ and the landlord became a \\\\nregistered supplier to them receiving the bond and two weeks rent in advance.\\\\n\\\\n7. Mr Hannibal said that he was told that he could not lodge the bond because there \\\\nwas already a bond paid for the premises, so he held on to the money.\\\\n\\\\n8. During the tenancy the landlord used the bond money to cover costs and rent he \\\\nfound owing.\\\\n\\\\n9. The tenant sought compensation, exemplary damages, refund of the bond \\\\nfollowing the end of the tenancy and reimbursement of the filling fee.\\\\n\\\\nIs this tenancy assigned or was it sublet to the tenant?\\\\n\\\\n10. The respondent landlord is the tenant of the property pursuant to a tenancy \\\\nagreement with the owner. The issue is whether the tenancy was assigned or \\\\nwhether the landlord is a sub-landlord and the tenant a sub-tenant.\\\\n\\\\n11. The Residential Tenancies Act 1983, RTA, defines assignment as a transfer to a \\\\nperson of all the rights that a tenant has under a tenancy agreement. See section \\\\n2, RTA.\\\\n\\\\n12. A tenant may assign a tenancy with the consent of the landlord. The effect of this \\\\nis that from the date of the assignment, that is that the date a new tenancy begins, \\\\nthe outgoing tenant ceases to be responsible to the landlord for obligations \\\\nimposed by the agreement and RTA. See section 43B,43C RTA\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4546673 3\\\\n\\\\n13. A sub-tenancy however is a tenancy agreement between a tenant (sub-landlord) \\\\nand another person (sub-tenant) where the tenant remains liable under a tenancy \\\\nagreement to the landlord. \\\\n\\\\n14. A sub-tenant is the grantee of a tenancy with the right to occupy the premises \\\\nexclusively or otherwise for rent, reflecting the definitions of ‘tenant and ‘tenancy’ \\\\nin section2(1) of the RTA.\\\\n\\\\n15. In the current circumstances a tenancy agreement was signed by the parties. The \\\\nstart date of this tenancy was 5 November 2022. The landlord received tenancy \\\\nentry costs from WINZ on 14 November 2022, communicated with the tenant, \\\\nmanaged the tenancy and referred repairs and concerns to the owner. \\\\n\\\\n16. The landlord argued that this was a casual arrangement that he organised to help \\\\nthe tenant out. I disagree. He was fully involved with the tenancy from signing an \\\\nagreement as the landlord, receiving rent and bond, being called on with the \\\\nowner for repairs and lawn mowing. The tenant had exclusive rights to occupy \\\\nthe premises.\\\\n\\\\n17.  I find that this was a landlord tenant relationship, and that the premises were  \\\\nsublet to the tenant by the landlord. I dismiss the argument that this was a casual \\\\nagreement between the parties. The tenancy is valid, and the RTA applies to all \\\\ntenancies between a landlord and tenant. \\\\n\\\\n18. Both the owner and landlord were involved with the management of the tenancy \\\\nand I find it appropriate to join the owner as a party to the proceedings.\\\\n\\\\n19. For the clarity in this I will refer to  Mr Hannibal, as the landlord and  [The tenant/s], \\\\nas the tenant.\\\\n\\\\nHow much is owing in rent?\\\\n\\\\n20. The tenant disputed the amount claimed for rent arrears at the end of the tenancy. \\\\n\\\\n21. The rent record provided by the landlords stated $1100.00 owing at the end of \\\\nthe tenancy. The tenant agreed that she had not paid rent for the last two weeks \\\\nrent for her tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n22. On 14 November WINZ paid the landlord 3 payments of $2000.00, $800.00, and \\\\n$400.00. On 8 November a further $1000.00 was paid. This was amounted to \\\\n$2800.00 for the bond and $1400.00 for 2 weeks rent in advance.\\\\n\\\\n23. A ‘bond record’ was supplied by the landlord and recorded a starting amount of \\\\n$2800.00. The record showed where the landlord deducted rent owing from this \\\\namount.\\\\n\\\\n24. The rent record did not record the $1400.00 payment from WINZ as 2 weeks rent \\\\nin advance. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4546673 4\\\\n\\\\n25. When this was taken into consideration the rent became $300.00 in credit. The \\\\nparties agreed that the tenant owed half rent for the first week she was at the \\\\ntenancy being $350.00. \\\\n\\\\n26. I find that the tenant owes $50.00 in rent arrears at the end of the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\nHow much is owed for water?\\\\n\\\\n27. There was no individual water metre installed at the premises and  no way to \\\\ndetermine the water use exclusively attributable to this tenancy. See section 39 \\\\nRTA.  The claim for compensation for water use Residential Tenancies Act 1986.\\\\n\\\\nHeathy Homes standards.\\\\n\\\\n28. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the landlord’s obligations \\\\nunder section 45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA), which \\\\nrequires compliance with the Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) \\\\n2019 (HHS). [The tenant/s] considers that the landlord has failed to comply with \\\\nthe HHS ventilation standard, the HHS draught stopping standard and the HHS \\\\ninsulation standard.\\\\n\\\\n29. The District Court has confirmed that when there are multiple claims for a breach \\\\nunder a single section (section 45 here), then only one order of exemplary \\\\ndamages can be made. I will therefore address the question of exemplary \\\\ndamages for all claimed section 45 breaches below.\\\\n\\\\nVentilation\\\\n\\\\n30. The ventilation standard sets out minimum expectations around windows and \\\\ndoors, and in particular the area of doors and windows that are openable.  The \\\\nstandard also requires that each kitchen and bathroom have extractor fans \\\\ninstalled with a minimum defined extraction capacity.  \\\\n\\\\n31. The HHS does provide exemptions in specific circumstances.\\\\n\\\\n32. The landlord and owner agreed that the premises did not have an extractor fan \\\\ninstalled in the kitchen or the bathroom saying that the premises was rented on \\\\nthe condition that the tenant knew that it may not comply with the HHS.\\\\n\\\\n33.  The landlord and owner confirmed that they relied on the tenant telling them what \\\\nwas wrong and then they would fix it immediately. They said money was not the \\\\nissue but getting service people to attend was delayed due to increased \\\\ndemands.\\\\n\\\\n34. The landlord took 5 months to install an extractor fan in the bathroom which was \\\\ncompleted just before the tenancy ended. The kitchen range hood was still in the \\\\ngarage. I find that they have breached the ventilation standards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4546673 5\\\\n\\\\nDraught stopping \\\\n\\\\n35. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the landlord’s obligations \\\\nunder section 45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 in relation to the \\\\nHHS draught stopping standard.\\\\n\\\\n36. The draught stopping standard requires that residential premises be free from \\\\nunreasonable gaps and holes that are not an intentional part of the building, which \\\\nallow draughts to arise.  \\\\n\\\\n37. The windows in the main bedroom did not shut properly, some of the hinges were \\\\nbent and there were gaps to the outside. The tenant said that it was a sunny warm \\\\nhouse, but she needed to be able to open and shut the windows. She said that \\\\nat the start of the tenancy she told the landlords partner about them,  but nothing \\\\nwas done. Photographs were provided in support.\\\\n\\\\n38. The owner found a Facebook post later in the tenancy where the tenant raised \\\\nconcern about the standard of the premises and noted the problem with the \\\\nwindows. The owner organised to get them replaced. They were repaired on 2 \\\\nMarch 2023.The tenancy ended on 7 March 2023.\\\\n\\\\n39. The landlord said that he did not know about the windows before this and they \\\\nwere waiting for the tenant to let them know what needed repairing. A tenant has \\\\nthe obligation to inform the landlord of any damages or repairs as soon as \\\\npossible after a tenancy begins, but a landlord is required to comply with the HHS \\\\nwithin 120 days of any tenancy that commenced after 28 August 2022.\\\\n\\\\n40. When I consider this with the statement that the landlord had not looked at the \\\\npremises before renting it out, I find that the landlord has breached the obligation \\\\ncomply with the HHS ventilation standard. \\\\n\\\\nInsulation\\\\n\\\\n41. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the obligations under section \\\\n45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 by failing to insulate the \\\\npremises in accordance with the Residential Tenancies (Smoke Alarms and \\\\nInsulation) Regulations 2016.\\\\n\\\\n42. From 1 July 2019, all residential premises must be insulated to a minimum \\\\nstandard.  Where the premises were insulated before 1 July 2016, the ceiling \\\\ninsulation must have an R-value of at least 1.9 (or 1.5 for houses of a brick or \\\\nconcrete block construction).  The underfloor insulation must have an R-value of \\\\nat least 0.9.  The insulation must be in reasonable condition.\\\\n\\\\n43. Where insulation is installed after 1 July 2016, the minimum R-value for ceiling \\\\ninsulation is 2.9 in Zones 1 and 2, and 3.3 for Zone 3 (Zone 3 covers the South \\\\nIsland and central North Island).  The minimum R-value for underfloor insulation \\\\nis 1.3.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4546673 6\\\\n\\\\n44. There are exceptions to these requirements, for example, where it is not \\\\nreasonably practicable, or where there is a habitable space above or below the \\\\nceiling or floor that would otherwise have to be insulated.\\\\n\\\\n45. The parties agreed that the premises were not insulated.\\\\n\\\\n46. I find they have committed an unlawful act by breaching the ventilation standard \\\\nthe draught standard and the insulation standard.\\\\n\\\\n47. Where a party has committed an unlawful act intentionally, the Tribunal may \\\\naward exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having \\\\nregard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other \\\\nparty, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) RTA. \\\\n\\\\n48. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages may \\\\nbe awarded up to a maximum of $7,200.00.  See section 45 (1)(A) and Schedule \\\\n1A RTA.\\\\n\\\\n49. Over and above the requirement to comply with the Healthy Homes Standards, \\\\nlandlords are to provide and maintain premises in a reasonable state of repair. \\\\nSee Section 45 (1)(b). \\\\n\\\\n50. In considering the requirements of section 109(3)RTA  I conclude that by not \\\\nlooking at the premises before renting them out, and stating that they probably \\\\ndo not comply, that the landlord and owner have ignored their responsibilities. \\\\nIgnorance is no excuse for noncompliance.\\\\n\\\\n51. It is not the role of the tenant to alert the landlord to their noncompliance with the \\\\nrequirements of the RTA or HHS. There is a positive obligation on the landlord to \\\\ncomply.\\\\n\\\\n52.  I find that these breaches are intentional. This is strengthened by the reliance on \\\\nthe tenant to tell the landlord and owner what was wrong with the premises. This \\\\nhands-off approach does not absolve the parties from their responsibilities.\\\\n\\\\n53. The effect of the unlawful acts for the tenant was a draughty and possibly a \\\\npremises unable to be secured. Without extractor fans mould is far more likely to \\\\noccur and homes with windows that do not seal are very hard to heat. The legal \\\\nrequirement to provide a warm insulated healthy home for tenants is what the \\\\nHHS have been introduced for and this is in the public interest.  \\\\n\\\\n54. I consider it just to make an order.\\\\n\\\\n55. The maximum award for breaching this section 45 (1A) is $7,200.00 and there \\\\nhave been three breaches of this section. I find it just to award an order of 25% \\\\nof the maximum, being an order of $1800.00.\\\\n\\\\nWas there a breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment.?\\\\n\\\\n56. [The tenant/s] claims the landlord has harassed them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4546673 7\\\\n\\\\n57. A landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace, comfort or privacy of the \\\\ntenant in their use of the premises.  See section 38(2) Residential Tenancies Act \\\\n1986. \\\\n\\\\n58. Breaching this obligation in circumstances that amount to harassment is an \\\\nunlawful act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of \\\\n$3,000.00.  See section 38(3) and Schedule 1A RTA.\\\\n\\\\n59. Harassment means \\\\\"to trouble, worry or distress\\\\\" or \\\\\"to wear out, tire, or exhaust\\\\\" \\\\nand \\\\\"indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person\\\\\".  \\\\nMacDonald v Dodds, CIV-2009-019-001524, DC Hamilton, 26 February 2010.\\\\n\\\\n60. The tenant provided a text from landlord’s partner saying that she had to leave \\\\nbecause she had people at her property that the landlord did not like. This was \\\\nlater changed.\\\\n\\\\n61. The landlord also sent the tenant a text saying that the ‘owner could do what the \\\\nfuck he wants m8,he is the owner, so do what you have to.’ \\\\n\\\\n62. The texts were inappropriate and incorrect, but I do not find that these texts \\\\namount to a breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment amounting to harassment.\\\\n\\\\n63. This claim is dismissed.\\\\n\\\\nBond\\\\n\\\\n64. [The tenant/s] claims the landlord has not lodged the bond with the Bond Centre \\\\nwithin the required time.\\\\n\\\\n65. A landlord must send any bond payment to the Bond Centre within 23 working \\\\ndays after the payment is received.  See section 19(1) Residential Tenancies Act \\\\n1986. \\\\n\\\\n66. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which the Tribunal may award \\\\nexemplary damages up to a maximum of $1,500.00.  See section 19(2) and \\\\nSchedule 1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.\\\\n\\\\n67. The landlord agrees that he was paid the bond by WINZ and tried to lodge it but \\\\nbecause he had paid the owner his bond, he was told that he could not lodge a \\\\nbond for this tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n68. The bond centre confirms that there is no bond lodged with this address and the \\\\nowner confirmed that he had not lodged the first bond.\\\\n\\\\n69. The landlord could have lodged the bond and failed to. When asked where the \\\\nmoney was, he said it was long gone and put toward the tenants costs and rent \\\\narrears he believed that the tenant owed. He did not have the funds now to cover \\\\nthe bond.\\\\n\\\\n70.  I find they have committed an unlawful act.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4546673 8\\\\n\\\\n71. Where a party has committed an unlawful act intentionally, the Tribunal may \\\\naward exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having \\\\nregard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other \\\\nparty, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) Residential Tenancies Act \\\\n1986.\\\\n\\\\n72. In consideration of the section 109(3) RTA,I find that this was an intentional \\\\nbreach. A bond is not the landlords money but the tenants to be held in trust by \\\\nthe bond centre for end of tenancy claims. The landlord has used the tenant’s \\\\nmoney and confirmed that none of it is left.\\\\n\\\\n73. The landlord said that he was a first-time landlord and did not know the \\\\nrequirements of the RTA. This is no excuse; it is the responsibility of a landlord \\\\nto know and comply with the requirements of the RTA.\\\\n\\\\n74. The consequence for the tenant is that she could not access the bond money for \\\\nwhich she could be held liable to repay to WINZ.\\\\n\\\\n75. It is in the public interest that tenants bond money is held by an independent bond \\\\ncentre as security for all parties.\\\\n\\\\n76. I find it just to make an award of $250.00.\\\\n\\\\nBond refund\\\\n\\\\n77. The tenant has applied for refund of the bond.  The landlord has a claim against \\\\nthe bond, but has not filed a counterclaim with Tenancy Services.  \\\\n\\\\n78. Section 22B(2) Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that, where a tenant \\\\napplies for refund of the bond, and the landlord seeks payment from the bond, \\\\nthe landlord must file an application setting out the details of the counterclaim. \\\\n\\\\n79.  Because the landlord has not filed a counterclaim the bond is refunded in full to \\\\nthe tenant.\\\\n\\\\nFencing\\\\n\\\\n80. The tenant claimed that the premises were not fully fenced for children and that \\\\nthis was agreed upon. The premises were located down a long driveway and \\\\nwere situated on a working farm. There was an incident where a child was found \\\\ndown the road.\\\\n\\\\n81. There was no evidence that the parties agreed this was a term of the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n82. This claim is dismissed.\\\\n\\\\nGardens\\\\n\\\\n83. The tenant said that she was told her rent included the lawns being mown and \\\\nthe gardens being done. This never happened. The landlord said that this was \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4546673 9\\\\n\\\\nnot agreed to but the owner and himself mowed the lawns on occasions and when \\\\nasked.\\\\n\\\\n84. There was no evidence provided that the rent included lawn and garden \\\\nmaintenance. This claim is dismissed. \\\\n\\\\n85. Because [The tenant/s] has substantially succeeded with the claim I have \\\\nreimbursed the filing fee.\\\\n\\\\nT Harris\\\\n14 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4546673 10\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

The landlord attended the hearing. The tenant did not appear.\\\\n\\\\n2. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, compensation, exemplary damages, \\\\nrefund of the bond, and reimbursement of the filing fee following the end of the \\\\ntenancy.\\\\n\\\\nHow much is owed for rent and water rates?\\\\n\\\\n3. The tenancy ended on 7 July 2023. The landlord provided rent records and water \\\\nrates invoices which prove the amount owing at the end of the tenancy. \\\\n\\\\nDid the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?\\\\n\\\\n4. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean and \\\\ntidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all chattels \\\\nprovided for their benefit. See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential Tenancies Act \\\\n1986. The tenant is required to replace worn out smoke alarm batteries during the \\\\ntenancy. See section 40(1)(ca) Residential Tenancies Act 1986. The tenant must \\\\nalso replace standard light bulbs.\\\\n\\\\n5. The tenant did not leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not \\\\nremove a significant amount of rubbish. The premises required extensive cleaning \\\\nto bring it up to a reasonable standard. \\\\n\\\\n6. The tenant did not return the keys or garage remotes. \\\\n\\\\n7. The following chattels were missing at the end of the tenancy: plugs from \\\\nbathrooms and insinkerator stopper. The landlord also had to replace light bulbs. \\\\n\\\\n8. The amounts ordered are proved. I have reduced the amount claimed for cleaning \\\\nto $25.00 per hour for the work done by the owners for a total amount of $1550.00 \\\\nfor 31 hours (2 people). I find the time spent was reasonable given the filthy state \\\\nthe premises was left in. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4664979 3\\\\n\\\\nIs the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?\\\\n\\\\n9. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy \\\\nand is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the \\\\ntenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the \\\\ndamage. Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their \\\\npermission. See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.\\\\n\\\\n10. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord\\'s \\\\ninsurance, the tenant\\'s liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or \\\\nfour weeks\\' rent (or four weeks\\' market rent in the case of a tenant paying income-\\\\nrelated rent). See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  \\\\n\\\\n11. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord\\'s insurance, the \\\\ntenant\\'s liability is limited to four weeks\\' rent (or market rent). See section 49B(3)(b) \\\\nRTA. Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the tenant\\'s conduct, the \\\\nproperty is treated as if it is not insured against the damage. See section \\\\n49B(3A)(a) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n12. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which \\\\nresults from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence. This \\\\napplies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are \\\\nresponsible for. See section 49B(1) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n13. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the \\\\nnecessary steps to achieve that purpose. Damage is also intentional where a \\\\nperson does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage is a \\\\ncertainty. See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.\\\\n\\\\n14. The landlord withdrew claims relating to the benchtop and floorboards totalling \\\\n$13,443.85. \\\\n\\\\n15. I find that the following intentional and extensive damage was caused during the \\\\ntenancy: multiple holes in walls throughout the premises, smashed doors, carpet \\\\ndamaged by extensive staining and faeces throughout, garage carpet damaged by \\\\nextensive oil stains, broken insinkerator, dishwasher door damaged, ceilings \\\\ndamaged, blinds broken, broken shower trap, broken window in lounge; and \\\\nmultiple electrical repairs due to damaged heat pump and rangehood, oven floor, \\\\nlight fitting in bedroom, and extractor fan in bathroom. \\\\n\\\\n16. The damage is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved \\\\nliability for the damage. \\\\n\\\\n17. The amounts ordered are proved. The landlord claimed $549.00 for a new \\\\ndishwasher. However, I have reduced this by 50% to reflect likely repair costs as I \\\\nam not persuaded a new machine was required when the door could have been \\\\nfixed/replaced. \\\\n\\\\n18. I have taken into account betterment and depreciation in relation to the paintwork \\\\nand carpets. The landlord should be returned to the position they would have been \\\\nin had the tenant not breached their obligations, and should not be better or worse \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4664979 4\\\\n\\\\noff.  In calculating depreciation, I have taken into account the age and condition of \\\\nthe items at the start of the tenancy (3 years) and their likely useful lifespan.   \\\\n\\\\n19. The landlord made a successful insurance claim of $13,800.00 for the damages \\\\nand this amount has been deducted off the amount awarded by the Tribunal. \\\\n\\\\n20. The also landlord claimed 4 weeks lost rent due to the extensive nature of the \\\\ndamage and time taken for repairs. While a realistic landlord’s business plan should \\\\ninclude an allowance for some loss of rent between tenancies, I acknowledge the \\\\nextent of the damage and the time it took to remedy which inevitably led to a delay \\\\nin re-letting. I award 3 weeks lost rent for a total of $2,250.00 as fair, reasonable \\\\nand proportionate compensation. \\\\n\\\\nExemplary damages\\\\n\\\\n21. Boutique Rentals Bop Limited claims the tenant has used the premises unlawfully, \\\\nby using or permitting the use of methamphetamine at the premises. \\\\n\\\\n22. A tenant must not use the premises or permit the premises to be used for an \\\\nunlawful purpose. See section 40(2)(b) Residential Tenancies Act 1986.\\\\n\\\\n23. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages may be \\\\nawarded up to a maximum of $1,800.00. See section 40(3A)(c) and Schedule 1A \\\\nResidential Tenancies Act 1986.\\\\n\\\\n24. The landlord provided a composite test for methamphetamine dated 10 July 2023 \\\\nwhich records a level of 37.40ug/100cm for the 10 areas tested.\\\\n\\\\n25. However, the landlord faces an evidential difficulty in proving this part of the claim. \\\\nThe ‘ingoing’ test for methamphetamine was done some 4 months before this \\\\ntenancy started. In these circumstances, I am unable to conclude that the tenant \\\\nused the premises for an unlawful purpose during this tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n26. This part of the claim is dismissed. \\\\n\\\\n27. As the landlord has substantially succeeded with the claim, the tenant must \\\\nreimburse the filing fee.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nA Macpherson\\\\n\\\\n28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4664979 5\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

An order for suppression is made of the Landlord’s name and identifying details.\\\\n\\\\n2. The application is dismissed.\\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. Both parties attended the hearing.\\\\n\\\\n2. This application was filed on 20 March 2023. It relates to a tenancy which \\\\nterminated on 20 July 2015. The applicant claims compensation against the \\\\nlandlord for a range of factors, including for failure to return the bond, unfair \\\\nincreases in rent, wrongful termination of the tenancy and for the allegedly poor \\\\ncondition of the property, including an allegation of mushrooms growing on the \\\\ncarpet in the lounge. \\\\n\\\\n3. As was discussed with the parties at the outset of the hearing, the question of \\\\njurisdiction arises because of the length of time that has passed between the end \\\\nof the tenancy and the date of the application being filed and also because of the \\\\nfact that this matter has been dealt with previously by the Tribunal. \\\\n\\\\nBackground facts \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4534511 2\\\\n\\\\n4. A brief summary of the earlier orders of the Tribunal is as follows: \\\\n\\\\na) On 22 July 2015, an order was made granting possession of the premises to \\\\nthe landlord. The applicant, who was then the tenant of the premises, was \\\\nordered to pay various rent arrears to the landlord. It was recorded in the order \\\\nthat the applicant did not appear on that date. \\\\n\\\\nb) On 25 September 2015, the Tribunal made orders for the applicant to pay \\\\ndamages to the landlord for the costs of lock replacement, storage costs and a \\\\nremoval truck. Deducted from the amount awarded to the landlord was the bond \\\\nof $550. Also deducted was $130.00 for a rent overpayment. After those \\\\ndeductions, the amount payable by the applicant was only $113.49. It was \\\\nrecorded in the decision that the applicant did not appear on that date. \\\\n\\\\nc) The applicant then applied for a rehearing out of time, and that application \\\\ncame back before the Tribunal on 16 May 2016. It was recorded in the Tribunal’s \\\\ndecision of that date that an earlier application for a rehearing by the applicant \\\\nhad been dismissed at her request. After hearing from the parties, the Tribunal \\\\ndetermined that the applicant had failed to establish the necessary grounds for a \\\\nrehearing. \\\\n\\\\nd) On 25 May 2022, the applicant brought a fresh claim against the landlord with \\\\nrespect to these premises. Included in her application was a request for the bond \\\\nto be refunded and allegations that she had been wrongfully evicted from the \\\\npremises, as well as various allegations about unlawful increases in rent and the \\\\nquality of the premises including mushrooms growing in the lounge and other \\\\nalleged faults.  \\\\n\\\\ne) The Tribunal set the matter down for a hearing on the question of jurisdiction \\\\ngiven the Limitation Act 2010. The applicant did not appear at the hearing and \\\\nher application was dismissed on 31 August 2022. \\\\n\\\\nf) An application was filed for a rehearing. According to the applicant today, she \\\\nhad appeared at the courthouse but may have been near the wrong courtroom at \\\\nwhen the matter was called. \\\\n\\\\ng) On 15 September 2022, the application for a rehearing was dismissed. \\\\nRecorded by the adjudicator in their decision was the following:\\\\n\\\\n3. The tenant seeks to re-open matters dealt with by the Tribunal in 2015 when orders were \\\\nmade. \\\\n\\\\n4. The landlord attended the hearing on 31 August 2022 and submitted that the application was \\\\nvexatious and outside the Limitation Act time frame.\\\\n\\\\nh) On 6 October 2020 the Tribunal dismissed a second application for a \\\\nrehearing. \\\\n\\\\nAnalysis \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4534511 3\\\\n\\\\n5. Section 11 of the Limitation Act 2010 provides: \\\\nDefence to money claim filed after applicable period\\\\n\\\\n(1) It is a defence to a money claim if the defendant proves that the date on which the claim is \\\\nfiled is at least 6 years after the date of the act or omission on which the claim is based).\\\\n\\\\n6. Section 92A of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that:\\\\nThe Tribunal may strike out, in whole or in part, a proceeding if satisfied that it—\\\\n\\\\n(a) discloses no reasonable cause of action; or\\\\n\\\\n(b) is likely to cause prejudice or delay; or\\\\n\\\\n(c) is frivolous or vexatious; or\\\\n\\\\n(d) is otherwise an abuse of process.\\\\n\\\\n7. The matters raised within this application appear to be well outside the six year \\\\ntime frame for the bringing of any claim for damages against another party. \\\\n\\\\n8. More significantly, the subject matter of this application is essentially the same as \\\\nthe application that was filed in 2022. Similar allegations are made in that the two \\\\nclaims essentially relate to the manner of termination of the tenancy, the alleged \\\\nquality of the premises, and the question of bond. Where an application is made \\\\nto the Tribunal which is dismissed and where two applications for rehearing and \\\\nrelation to that application are also unsuccessful, it is an abuse of  process and / \\\\nor vexatious for the Tribunal to allow a fresh application to be made raising, \\\\nessentially, all of those same issues. \\\\n\\\\n9. In her evidence today, the applicant said, several times, words to the effect, that \\\\nthe bond had not been refunded to her. I have set out a summary of the prior \\\\norders of the Tribunal to clarify for her benefit that whilst the bond may not have \\\\nbeen paid to her, it has been taken into account in fixing amounts that she should \\\\npay to the landlord. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\nD Watson\\\\n\\\\n21 August 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4534511 4\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression \\\\norders apply around publication of this decision. \\\\n\\\\n2.  William Andrew Nurse to pay Patricia Quinn and Denis Quinn $806.24 from the \\\\nbond, calculated as shown in table below. \\\\n\\\\nDescription Landlord Tenant\\\\nCleaning: Curtains $285.80  \\\\nLawns and Garden work $200.00  \\\\nRepairs: Flooring $300.00  \\\\nFiling fee reimbursement $20.44  \\\\nTotal award $806.24  \\\\nBond $806.24 $243.76\\\\n\\\\n3. The Bond Centre is to pay the bond of $1,050.00 (3358501-006) immediately \\\\napportioned as follows:\\\\n\\\\nPatricia Quinn and Denis Quinn: $806.24\\\\n\\\\nWilliam Andrew Nurse: $243.76\\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. Both parties attended the hearing.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4630850 2\\\\n\\\\n2. The landlord has applied for compensation, refund of the bond, and \\\\nreimbursement of the filing fee following the end of the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\nDid the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?\\\\n\\\\n3. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean \\\\nand tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all \\\\nchattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential \\\\nTenancies Act 1986.  \\\\n\\\\n4. The landlord claimed that the tenant did not leave the gardens in the condition \\\\nthey were in at the start of the tenancy.  The photographs show the garden to \\\\nbe extremely well presented at the start of the tenancy.   The landlord claims \\\\nthat the tenant agreed to maintain the gardens to that standard.  The Act \\\\nrequires the tenant to leave the gardens reasonably clean and tidy.  The RTA \\\\napplies despite a provision to the contrary in a tenancy agreement – see s11 \\\\nRTA.\\\\n\\\\n5. The photographs show that the gardens at the end of the tenancy were \\\\ngenerally tidy with some areas requiring additional weeding.  I award the \\\\nlandlord $200 of the $480.00 claimed.\\\\n\\\\n6. In relation to the paths and water blasting.  The condition at the end of the \\\\ntenancy was consistent with winter outdoor conditions and the cleaning required \\\\nis a landlord maintenance obligation.\\\\n\\\\n7. A set of curtains had to be dry cleaned and Mr Nurse agreed to meet that cost \\\\nof $285.80.\\\\n\\\\nIs the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?\\\\n\\\\n8. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy \\\\nand is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the \\\\ntenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the \\\\ndamage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their \\\\npermission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.\\\\n\\\\n9. The landlord claims that the polyurethane surface to the timber floor was \\\\ndamaged during the tenancy.  The landlord claims $1,725.00 for repairs but has \\\\nnot carried out the work.\\\\n\\\\n10. The photographs show that an area of the floor surface was damaged by \\\\ncastors from a chair during the tenancy.  This damage is more extensive than \\\\nthe wear and tear that can be expected from everyday use.  The evidence also \\\\nestablished that Mr Nurse became aware that the particular chair was causing \\\\ndegradation or damage to the flooring at some point during the tenancy but did \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4630850 3\\\\n\\\\nnot take any steps to prevent further damage until asked to do so by the \\\\nlandlord.\\\\n\\\\n11. I find that, at least some of, the damage to the polyurethane surface was \\\\ncarelessly caused during this tenancy.  However, the coating is at least 9 years \\\\nold.  It does not have an infinite life.  Other areas of the floor remain in good \\\\ncondition while some, particularly around the dining table, are more worn.  The \\\\nlandlord has not yet had the floor recoated so has not incurred any cost.\\\\n\\\\n12. I have considered betterment and depreciation.  In calculating depreciation, I \\\\nhave considered the age and condition of the items at the start of the tenancy \\\\nand their likely useful lifespan.   I award $300 of the $1,725.00 claimed for floor \\\\ndamage, recognising the reduction in the surface’s likely lifespan.\\\\n\\\\n13. As the landlord was partially successful, I have awarded reimbursement of the \\\\nTribunal application fee.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nR Morgan\\\\n\\\\n28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4630850 4\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

The landlord attended the hearing. There was no appearance by the tenant. \\\\n\\\\n2. The landlord has applied for rent and water arrears and termination of the \\\\ntenancy for breach of the tenant’s obligations.\\\\n\\\\n3. The landlord provided invoices for water usage which confirm the amount \\\\noutstanding. Having sighted these invoices I am satisfied that the tenant is \\\\nresponsible for payment of this overdue amount.\\\\n\\\\nShould the tenancy be terminated?\\\\n\\\\n4. The Tribunal may terminate a tenancy for breach where, due to the nature or \\\\nextent of the breach, it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate.  See section \\\\n56(1) Residential Tenancies Act 1986.  \\\\n\\\\n5. Where the breach is capable of remedy the landlord must first serve a notice on \\\\nthe tenant requiring them to remedy the breach within at least 14 days and \\\\nestablish that the tenant has failed to do so.\\\\n\\\\n6. The tenant has breached their obligations by failing to pay the rent and bond as \\\\nrequired pursuant to the signed Tenancy Agreement dated 16 August 2023. \\\\n\\\\n7. The landlord served a 14-day notice on the tenant on 21 August 2023, and the \\\\ntenant did not remedy the breach within the required period.\\\\n\\\\n8. It would be inequitable to refuse to terminate the tenancy based on the \\\\nevidence I have been provided with in support of this application. I am not \\\\nsatisfied that the tenant is unlikely to commit further breaches. The landlord \\\\nsays that no rent has been received by the tenant since the start of the tenancy \\\\ndespite numerous requests. The tenant has also failed to pay the bond. I have \\\\nsighted numerous email exchanges between the parties where the tenant \\\\nadvises that the rent will be paid. On each occasion there has been no rent \\\\nreceived by the landlord.  \\\\n\\\\n9. The landlord has applied for rent arrears and has provided rent records which \\\\nprove the amount owing as at todays’ date.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4664109 3\\\\n\\\\n10. Because Barfoot & Thompson Limited As Agent For Daniel Reid- Watson has \\\\nwholly succeeded with the claim I must reimburse the filing fee.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nM Manhire\\\\n\\\\n28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4664109 4\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

The application for compensation for damage is dismissed.\\\\n\\\\n4. The application for termination of the tenancy is withdrawn.\\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. Both parties attended the hearing. The landlord was represented by the \\\\nproperty manager who manages the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4659674 2\\\\n\\\\n2. The landlord has applied for an order terminating the tenancy for continuing \\\\nbreaches by the tenant failing to pay rent when due, rent arrears and \\\\ncompensation for damage done to part of the neighbouring property owned by \\\\nthe same landlord.\\\\n\\\\n3. The landlord did not pursue the application for termination today. I have \\\\nrecorded the withdrawal of that part of the application.\\\\n\\\\nRent arrears\\\\n\\\\n4. The tenancy is a long tenancy by New Zealand standards; it began on 30 \\\\nSeptember 2017.\\\\n\\\\n5. For most of the duration of the tenancy the rent has been paid on time or has \\\\nbeen in credit.\\\\n\\\\n6. The tenant has experienced some recent difficulties which have resulted in rent \\\\narrears. She is confident that she can continue to manage her weekly rent but \\\\ncannot immediately meet her rent arrears.\\\\n\\\\n7. The tenant accepted the amount of rent owing. I have made a rent arrears order \\\\nby consent.\\\\n\\\\n8. If the rent arrears are not paid, the tenant risks having the tenancy terminated \\\\nshould the landlord apply again.\\\\n\\\\nCan the Tribunal award compensation for damage?\\\\n\\\\n9. The landlord seeks compensation (the insurance excess and other costs \\\\namounting to $1,189.50) as a result of a former friend of the tenant leaving the \\\\npremises in his car and damaging the fence and wheelie bin of the neighbouring \\\\nproperty, also owned by the same landlord.\\\\n\\\\n10. Section 40(2)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) provides that the \\\\ntenant shall not intentionally, or carelessly damage, or permit any other person \\\\nto damage, the premises. Premises is defined in section 2 RTA to include any \\\\npart of any premises.\\\\n\\\\n11. Section 41 RTA sets out a tenant’s responsibility for the actions of others.  A \\\\ntenant is responsible for any intentional or careless damage to the premises \\\\nwhile the tenant is in the premises. There is a presumption that the tenant \\\\npermitted the other person to be in the premises, although the tenant can rebut \\\\nthat presumption.\\\\n\\\\n12. Here, the tenant did not damage the premises, nor did she permit her former \\\\nfriend to damage the premises. That person has caused damage to another \\\\nproperty. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4659674 3\\\\n\\\\n13. The fact that the other property is owned by the same landlord does not make \\\\nthis tenant liable. The damage was not done to the premises (the tenancy \\\\npremises), it was done to another property.\\\\n\\\\n14. The issue of liability for the damage done to the other property (even though \\\\nowned by the same owner as the tenancy premises at issue here) is a civil \\\\ndispute between the property owner and the person who caused the damage.\\\\n\\\\n15. The Tribunal cannot make an order against this tenant for damage done by a \\\\nthird party to another property.\\\\n\\\\n16. The application for compensation for damage is dismissed.\\\\n\\\\nResult\\\\n\\\\n17. The tenant will pay the landlord $870.44 comprising rent arrears of $850.00 and \\\\nthe Tribunal filing fee of $20.44.\\\\n\\\\n18. The application for compensation is dismissed.\\\\n\\\\n19. The application for termination of the tenancy is withdrawn.\\\\n\\\\nName suppression\\\\n\\\\n20. Both parties applied for a name suppression order. Each party has succeeded \\\\nin part. There is no public interest in this order being published. The parties \\\\nhave had a long landlord/ tenant relationship, hopefully one that will continue. I \\\\nhave therefore made a name suppression order for both parties.\\\\n\\\\nJ Greene\\\\n15 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4659674 4\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

The Tribunal orders suppression of the Tenant’s name and identifying details.\\\\n\\\\n2. The landlord’s application for a rehearing is granted to the extent set out on this \\\\norder. \\\\n\\\\n3. The Order of 27 June 2023 is set aside and replaced with these orders below.  \\\\n\\\\nDescription Landlord Tenant\\\\nTotal award   \\\\n\\\\n$400.00\\\\n\\\\nCompensation: unrepaired UV filtration system, $40 \\\\nx 14 weeks\\\\n\\\\n $560.00\\\\n\\\\nFiling fee reimbursement  $20.44\\\\nTotal award  $980.44\\\\nTotal payable by Landlord to Tenant  $980.44\\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. Only the landlord attended today’s hearing to consider the landlord’s application \\\\nfor a rehearing.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4514266 2\\\\n\\\\n2. On 27 June 2023 I ordered the landlord to pay the tenants compensation and \\\\nexemplary damages totalling $1,840.44 for reasons set out in that order. \\\\n\\\\n3. The landlord has applied for a rehearing on these grounds:\\\\n\\\\na) Caylin Hutchings should not be recorded as landlord because he had not \\\\nsigned the tenancy agreement.\\\\n\\\\nb) A thermostatically controlled heater has been provided to the premises at \\\\nthe start of the tenancy on 18 December 2021 but the tenant chose not to \\\\navail themselves to it. \\\\n\\\\nc) There is no breach to the tenant’s quiet enjoyment when the landlord’s son \\\\ncame on the grounds of the property briefly to repair a water tank leak.  \\\\n\\\\n4. Having heard from the landlord, I am satisfied that there has been a miscarriage \\\\nof justice and a limited rehearing should be granted on my previous order. \\\\n\\\\n5. Prior to the installation of a new woodburner, a thermostatically controlled heater \\\\nhas been made available to the tenant at the start of the tenancy on 18 December \\\\n2021 but the tenant chose not to avail themselves to it. The landlord left the heater \\\\nfor the tenant’s use but after a few weeks of the tenant not wanting the heater, \\\\nthe landlord removed it from the premises. \\\\n\\\\n6. Given those facts, I consider it just to remove the previous compensation award \\\\nof $660.00 in respect of purported breach of Housing Improvement Regulations \\\\n1947 (SR 1947/200) (‘the HIR’) on the provision that that every living room shall \\\\nbe fitted with a fireplace and chimney or other approved form of heating \\\\n(regulation 6). \\\\n\\\\n7. While the existing fireplace at the start of the tenancy (in 18 December 2021, not \\\\n16 October 2021) is unusable as a source of heating, the landlord has provided \\\\nanother approved form of heating to the living room before a wood burner was \\\\nlater installed. \\\\n\\\\n8. I am also satisfied that the landlord has not breached the tenant’s quiet enjoyment \\\\nand privacy in their use of the premises when the landlord’s son Caylin came onto \\\\nthe grounds of the property without prior notice or warning to attend to repairs on \\\\nthe water tank. \\\\n\\\\n9. The landlord was attempting an urgent fix on a leaking water tank at the time; he \\\\nhad merely called out to the tenant to announce his presence. There was no \\\\nintention to breach the tenant’s quiet enjoyment and any inconvenience to the \\\\ntenant would be minor. \\\\n\\\\n10. Given those facts, I consider it just to remove the previous compensation award \\\\nof $200.00 in respect of a purported breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment. \\\\n\\\\n11. Lastly, I do not consider it necessary to remove Caylin Hutchings from the order. \\\\nCaylin was named as a co-landlord even though he had not signed the tenancy \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4514266 3\\\\n\\\\nagreement. During the tenancy, he had been on the property doing a number \\\\nchores, including repairs to the water tank. \\\\n\\\\n12. I therefore consider that Kim Hutchings have signed the tenancy agreement on \\\\nCaylin’s behalf as co-landlord. \\\\n\\\\n13. Having granted a limited rehearing of my earlier order, I consider it appropriate to \\\\nreplace the earlier order of 27 June 2023 with the above orders.\\\\n\\\\nJ Tam\\\\n28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4514266 4\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal \\\\norders suppression of the Landlord name and identifying details.\\\\n\\\\n2. The tenancy of Fran Olson at [Tenancy address suppressed] is terminated, and \\\\npossession is granted to [The landlord/s], at 11.59pm on Tuesday 17 October \\\\n2023. \\\\n\\\\n3. Fran Olson must pay [The landlord/s] $374.01 immediately, calculated as \\\\nshown in the table below:\\\\n\\\\nDescription Landlord Tenant\\\\nRent arrears to 29.9.2023 $353.57  \\\\nFiling fee reimbursement $20.44  \\\\nTotal award $374.01  \\\\nTotal payable by Tenant to Landlord $374.01  \\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. The landlord attended the hearing by teleconference. The Tribunal made three \\\\nattempts to call the tenant on the cell phone number provided in the application, \\\\nbut all calls diverted to voicemail. I am satisfied that the tenant received notice \\\\nof the hearing but did not attend.\\\\n\\\\n2. The landlord has applied for termination of the tenancy for breach of the \\\\ntenant’s obligations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4653691 2\\\\n\\\\nShould the tenancy be terminated?\\\\n\\\\n3. The Tribunal may terminate a tenancy for breach where, due to the nature or \\\\nextent of the breach, it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate.  See section \\\\n56(1) Residential Tenancies Act 1986.  \\\\n\\\\n4. Where the breach is capable of remedy the landlord must first serve a notice on \\\\nthe tenant requiring them to remedy the breach within at least 14 days and \\\\nestablish that the tenant has failed to do so.\\\\n\\\\n5. The tenant has breached their obligations by failing to pay rent when it is due. \\\\nThere are several instances of the tenant falling into arrears in January, and \\\\nFebruary 2023 and more recently, continuous arrears since June 2023.\\\\n\\\\n6. The landlord has served several 14-day notices on the tenant. In relation to the \\\\nnotices dated 8 June 2023 and 8 August 2023 the tenant did not remedy the \\\\nbreaches within the required period. Furthermore, the tenant was more than 21 \\\\ndays in arrears as at 8 September 2023. The tenant is still in arrears at the \\\\nhearing date. \\\\n\\\\n7. I am satisfied on the evidence that it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate \\\\nthe tenancy because there is a pattern of the tenant failing to pay rent on time \\\\nand failing to remedy the rent arrears as required in the 14 day notices served \\\\non the tenant. \\\\n\\\\n8. The tenancy is therefore terminated. The landlord provided evidence of \\\\ndiscussions with the tenant agreeing to termination of the tenancy on 17 \\\\nOctober 2023. As requested by the landlord the tenancy is terminated with \\\\neffect on that date.\\\\n\\\\n9. The landlord provided rent records which prove the amount owing at the \\\\nhearing date. I have calculated the arrears owed up to the end of the current \\\\nrent period on Friday 29 September 2023. The tenant will be liable for \\\\ncontinuing weekly rent of $500 next due on Saturday 30 September 2023 until \\\\nthe tenancy terminates. \\\\n\\\\n10. As the landlord has wholly succeeded with their application, they are entitled to \\\\nsuppression of their name and identifying details and to reimbursement of the \\\\nfiling fee.\\\\n\\\\nK Stirling, 28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4653691 3\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression \\\\norders apply around publication of this decision. \\\\n\\\\n2. The tenancy of Natasha Mohr at 3B Nield Road, Manurewa, Auckland 2102 is \\\\nterminated, and possession is granted to Inspire Property Management Limited - \\\\nAshmith Nand And Arishma Lal, at 11.59 pm on Tuesday 3 October 2023.\\\\n\\\\n3. The landlord’s claim for exemplary damages is dismissed.\\\\n\\\\n4. The landlord’s claim for compensation is adjourned.  A further hearing is to be \\\\nscheduled in person, on the next date and time available, before any Adjudicator. \\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. The hearing was held by teleconference on 6 September 2023.  Both parties \\\\nattended the hearing. \\\\n\\\\n2. The landlord has applied for termination of the tenancy for breach of the tenant’s \\\\nobligations, exemplary damages and compensation for methamphetamine \\\\ntesting and decontamination.\\\\n\\\\n3. Given the urgent nature of the claim and that no in person hearing dates were \\\\navailable until November 2023, this matter was scheduled for a remote hearing \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4658471 2\\\\n\\\\nto consider the claim for termination and exemplary damages only.  The claim for \\\\ncompensation is adjourned to another date. \\\\n\\\\nShould the tenancy be terminated?\\\\n\\\\n4. The Tribunal may terminate a tenancy for breach where, due to the nature or \\\\nextent of the breach, it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate.  See section \\\\n56(1) Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (“the RTA”).\\\\n\\\\n5. Where the breach is capable of remedy the landlord must first serve a notice on \\\\nthe tenant requiring them to remedy the breach within at least 14 days and \\\\nestablish that the tenant has failed to do so.\\\\n\\\\n6. Where the breach is not capable of remedy, the landlord is not expressly required \\\\nto serve a 14-day breach notice on the tenant.  A breach is not capable to remedy \\\\nwhere the thing done, or its effect, cannot be undone.  \\\\n\\\\n7. However, unless the breach is serious, the Tribunal usually requires the landlord \\\\nto have warned the tenant about the likely consequences of continued breach \\\\nbefore it will exercise its discretion to terminate. \\\\n\\\\n8. The landlord claims the tenant has used the premises unlawfully, by using or \\\\npermitting the smoking of methamphetamine in the premises.\\\\n\\\\n9. A tenant must not use the premises or permit the premises to be used for an \\\\nunlawful purpose. See section 40(2)(b) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n10. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages may \\\\nbe awarded up to a maximum of $1,800.00. See section 40(3A)(c) and Schedule \\\\n1A RTA.\\\\n\\\\n11. Tenants are liable for the actions of others who are at the premises with their \\\\npermission. See section 41 RTA.\\\\n\\\\n12. It is unlawful to possess or consume methamphetamine. See section 7(1)(a) and \\\\nSchedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975.\\\\n\\\\n13. The landlord provided a pre-tenancy methamphetamine test establishing that \\\\nprior to the start of the tenancy, there was no detectable methamphetamine at \\\\nthe premises.\\\\n\\\\n14. The landlord provided a further methamphetamine test carried out in August 2023 \\\\nwhich returned positive traces of methamphetamine ranging from 2.94 μg to \\\\n11.60 μg.  Most of the areas tested were at the level of 11.60 μg, other than \\\\nbedrooms 3 and 4. \\\\n\\\\n15. Based on that evidence, I am satisfied that methamphetamine has been \\\\nconsumed in the premises at some point during the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n16. The breach is not capable of remedy because it is serious and constitutes use\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4658471 3\\\\n\\\\nof the premises for an unlawful purpose.\\\\n\\\\n17. There is no evidence that methamphetamine has been consumed by the tenant \\\\nherself. She was shocked and upset at what was found. The tenant suggested \\\\nhowever that she did find out afterwards that someone who had visited or stayed \\\\nat the premises (perhaps a family member) may have done so without her \\\\nknowledge or consent.\\\\n\\\\n18. Methamphetamine can last on surfaces for lengthy periods of time. There is no \\\\nway to determine when methamphetamine was consumed. I can only be satisfied \\\\nthat it was consumed at some point during the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n19. The tenant did not suggest that anyone was in her premises without her \\\\npermission. Based on that, I must infer that whoever has smoked \\\\nmethamphetamine was at the premises with her permission. That unfortunately \\\\nmeans she is liable for their acts even though she may not have known what they \\\\nwere doing.\\\\n\\\\n20. I therefore find that the tenant has committed an unlawful act.\\\\n\\\\n21. The seriousness of the unlawful activity in question here is at the upper end of \\\\nthe scale and I am satisfied it would be inequitable to refuse to make an order \\\\nterminating the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n22. I appreciate that the tenant’s personal circumstances are such that moving out \\\\nwill be difficult.  However, I cannot consider the impact on the tenant, in making \\\\nan order for termination of the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n23. Accordingly, the landlord’s application for termination of the tenancy is granted.\\\\n\\\\n24. Given my finding, it is not necessary to address the other ground relied on by the \\\\nlandlord for termination.\\\\n\\\\nShould the Tribunal order the tenant to pay exemplary damages?\\\\n\\\\n25. Exemplary damages are designed to punish and deter. They are like a fine. In \\\\nAuckland City Council v Blundell [1986] NZLR 732 the Court of Appeal stated: \\\\n\\\\nExemplary and punitive [damages] are different words for the same \\\\nthing. The damages are exemplary because they are meant to teach \\\\nan example to the guilty officer and others. They are punitive \\\\nbecause they are meant to punish. They are like a fine, though they \\\\ngo to the citizen who has been the victim of conduct.\\\\n\\\\n26. Exemplary damages are awarded at the Tribunal’s discretion when one party has \\\\nproved that the other party has committed a defined unlawful act. The Tribunal \\\\nmust consider whether it would be just to do so, having regard to the party’s intent, \\\\nthe effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other party, and the public \\\\ninterest. See section 109(3) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4658471 4\\\\n\\\\n27. Intentional means that the party who has committed the breach must be aware \\\\nof it. The focus of the intention however must be the act (or omission) and not the \\\\nlegal knowledge of the offending party.\\\\n\\\\n28. In this case, the landlord submitted that whoever had smoked drugs in the \\\\nproperty must have been connected to the tenant in some way. They therefore \\\\nsay there was some element of knowledge on her part. Essentially, the landlord \\\\nis saying that the tenant must have known that person was a drug user and so \\\\nthere was a likelihood that drugs were going to be consumed while they were at \\\\nher property.\\\\n\\\\n29. I accept that there may be some basis for such a suspicion on the landlord’s part. \\\\nHowever, a suspicion is not proof. Bearing in mind that the landlord carries the \\\\nonus and burden of proof, I am not persuaded that it is more likely than not that \\\\nthe tenant was aware that methamphetamine had been smoked in her house.\\\\n\\\\n30. I therefore find that the breach was not intentional.\\\\n\\\\n31. Even if I had been persuaded that the breach was intentional, I do not consider it \\\\nwould have been just to award exemplary damages in this case. That is because \\\\nexemplary damages are meant to punish a guilty party, and it is difficult to see \\\\nhow the tenant’s conduct could be characterised in this way.\\\\n\\\\n31. The claim for exemplary damages is therefore dismissed.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nJ Setefano\\\\n\\\\n27 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4658471 5\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression \\\\norders apply around publication of this decision.\\\\n\\\\n2. Folole Hana Fiso must pay Hawick Qian $1,571.81 immediately, calculated as \\\\nshown in table below.\\\\n\\\\nDescription Landlord Tenant\\\\nRent arrears $857.14  \\\\nCleaning $400.00  \\\\nRubbish removal $1,854.23  \\\\nRepairs $360.00  \\\\nFiling fee reimbursement $20.44  \\\\nTotal award $3,491.81  \\\\nBond $1,920.00  \\\\nTotal payable by Tenant to Landlord $1,571.81  \\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. On 10 August 2023 I adjourned the landlord’s application for rent arrears, \\\\ncompensation, refund of the bond, and reimbursement of the filing fee following \\\\nthe end of the tenancy to allow the landlord to provide proper evidence to \\\\nsubstantiate his claims. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4625569 2\\\\n\\\\n2. Today he was represented by his colleague, Bernadine Wastney, from Manner \\\\nProperty Management. Although he had advised the Tribunal before the hearing \\\\nthat Ms Wastney would be attending, he did not apply to have a representative \\\\nappointed. Ms Wastney confirmed that Mr Qian is the owner and landlord of this \\\\nproperty. He should have attended himself or applied for the Tribunal to allow \\\\nrepresentation. I allowed Ms Wastney to attend on Mr Qian’s behalf.\\\\n\\\\n3. The tenant did not appear. Ms Wastney advised that the tenant had needed to \\\\nleave the property at short notice and was very apologetic that she had not \\\\nbeen able to attend to matters properly and she had signed over the bond to Mr \\\\nQian.\\\\n\\\\n4. Mr Qian has now provided a proper rent summary. The amount sought is \\\\nslightly more than in the original application but the rent summary makes it clear \\\\nthat it is owing. The tenant had not been in arrears until the end when she did \\\\nnot pay the last week and a bit. The amount of $857 owing to the date of \\\\ntermination on 24 March 2023 is proved.\\\\n\\\\nDid the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?\\\\n\\\\n5. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean \\\\nand tidy and remove all rubbish.  See section 40(1)(e) Residential Tenancies \\\\nAct 1986.  \\\\n\\\\n6. The landlord provided photos which showed that the tenant did not leave the \\\\npremises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not remove all rubbish. Ms \\\\nWastney had helped the landlord clean and tidy the property and she confirmed \\\\nthat the tenant had not undertaken any cleaning.\\\\n\\\\n7. The landlord submitted an invoice #2300132 dated 23 March from Feng Qian \\\\nJ&J Maintenance Service to Feng Qian1 for rubbish dispose for “Enviro waste”. \\\\nThis is the day before the rent was owed to. The quantity is 1 and the rate is \\\\nshown as $1,004.23. The labour is again, quantity 1 and the amount is $850. \\\\nThere is no breakdown of hours, hourly rate and no GST. The landlord should \\\\nprovide receipts and itemised accounts. However, I have decided the amount is \\\\nreasonable and have ordered the Tribunal to pay this.\\\\n\\\\n8. There is a second invoice #2300148 dated 24 March for $1,355.00 for cleaning. \\\\nThe quantity is again 1. The rate is $1,355. Again there is no hourly rate or \\\\nnumber of hours. I have allowed $400.00 for cleaning the property which is a \\\\nreasonable amount and in keeping with other claims before the Tribunal. \\\\n\\\\n1 The name on the tenancy agreement is Feng Qian\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4625569 3\\\\n\\\\nIs the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?\\\\n\\\\n9. The landlord has other claims for damage/repairs to the property. A landlord \\\\nmust prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy and is \\\\nmore than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the tenant \\\\nmust prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the damage.  \\\\nTenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their \\\\npermission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.\\\\n\\\\n10. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which \\\\nresults from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This \\\\napplies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are \\\\nresponsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n11. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the \\\\nnecessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a \\\\nperson does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage \\\\nis a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.\\\\n\\\\n12. The landlord provided a photograph showing a damaged tiles in the bathroom \\\\nand an itemised invoice dated 9 April 2021 from Odd Job Bob for replacing the \\\\nshower platform. The landlord also provided an email dated 16 May 2021 from \\\\nthe tenant asking if she can start making payments for the repairs in the \\\\nbathroom. I am satisfied that the damage occurred during the tenancy and it is \\\\nmore than fair wear and tear. I order the tenant to pay $360.88.\\\\n\\\\n13. There is a third invoice #2300134, also dated 23 March 2023 from Feng Qian \\\\nJ&J maintenance service. It lists a number of items totalling $1,493.92. The \\\\nitems listed are living room roll curtain replacement, shower door, repair, \\\\nbedroom wall paper damage, shower sink blockage, bedroom carpet \\\\nreplacement, towel rack broken, door handle, drawer handle. It is unclear \\\\nwhether the figures listed are disbursements or time spent. With the exception \\\\nof the claim for carpet, there are no invoices or receipts.\\\\n\\\\n14. The landlord has not provided entry photos or an entry report. The exit report is \\\\nblank apart from the entry of “N” for “No” in the “undamaged” column for Lounge \\\\nRoom and “N” for “No” in the “undamaged” column for the following items:\\\\n\\\\nStaircases/railings, Wheelie and recycle bins Pool/equipment. Street \\\\nnumber/letter box, External walls, Balcony/porch/deck, Awning/gutters,  \\\\nPaving/pergola, Garage/car port/ storeroom, Garden shed, Gates/fences,  \\\\nGrounds/garden, External taps/hose, Clothes line, Solar panels,  \\\\nPaths/driveway, Other.  \\\\n\\\\n15. This simply does not make sense. For example, there is no evidence of a pool \\\\nor solar panels in the photographs provided.\\\\n\\\\n16. The landlord was provided with an opportunity to properly substantiate his \\\\nclaims and has not done so. Although there is an invoice for replacement of \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4625569 4\\\\n\\\\nbedroom carpet, there is no photo of the damaged carpet, description of it in the \\\\nexit report, no explanation of the damage, no information about the age of the \\\\ncarpet. \\\\n\\\\n17. All of the claims in the invoice number #2300134 are dismissed.\\\\n\\\\n18. Because Hawick Qian has substantially succeeded with the claim I have \\\\nreimbursed the filing fee.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nT Baker\\\\n\\\\n28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4625569 5\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

Both parties attended the hearing.\\\\n\\\\n2. The Landlord argues that s 5(1)(n) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 \\\\n(“the Act”) applies and excludes this tenancy from the provisions of the Act.\\\\n\\\\n3. Just prior to the hearing I told the parties I would hear and determine the \\\\nissue of jurisdiction first, before hearing the substantive claim. I reiterated \\\\nthis at the hearing. \\\\n\\\\n4. For the reasons outlined below, I am satisfied s 5(1)(n) applies. \\\\nConsequently, there is no residential tenancy to which the Act applies.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4621351 2\\\\n\\\\nThe law\\\\n\\\\n1. Section 4 of the Act reads:\\\\n\\\\n“This Act applies to every tenancy for residential purposes except as specifically \\\\nprovided.” \\\\n\\\\nPrima facie, the premises at 18 Cambourne Road, Papatoetoe (the \\\\npremises) were used for residential purposes and as such as a starting \\\\npoint is covered by the Act, unless a section 5 exemption applies, and the \\\\nparties did not contract back into the Act.\\\\n\\\\n2. “Tenancy” is defined in section 2 of the Act as follows:\\\\n\\\\n“tenancy, in relation to any residential premises, means the right to occupy the \\\\npremises (whether exclusively or otherwise) in consideration for rent; and \\\\nincludes any tenancy of residential premises implied or created by any \\\\nenactment; and, where appropriate, also includes a former tenancy ….”. \\\\n\\\\n3. The Landlord argued that money was paid by the Occupants/Tenants in \\\\nexchange for occupancy rights and not as rent for tenancy. The \\\\nOccupants/Tenants argued that they paid rent and had a verbal residential \\\\ntenancy agreement with the Permila Ram Trust (the Trust) in exchange for \\\\n$400 per week for the first month, and $500 per week thereafter.  \\\\n\\\\n4. The exceptions to the Act are contained in s 5. Relevantly, s 5(1)(n) of the Act \\\\nprovides:\\\\n\\\\n“…where the premises, not being a boarding house, continue to be used, during \\\\nthe tenancy, principally as a place of residence by the landlord or the owner of the \\\\npremises or by any member of the landlord’s or owner’s family.”\\\\n\\\\n5. Under s 5 of the Act, member of the landlord\\'s or owner\\'s family means \\\\nany person who is related to the landlord or owner by blood, or through \\\\nmarriage, a civil union, or a de facto relationship; or by adoption.\\\\n\\\\n6. Section 2 of the Act, defines a landlord as “in relation to any residential \\\\npremises that are subject to a tenancy agreement, means the grantor of a \\\\ntenancy of the premises under the agreement…”\\\\n\\\\n7. The Trust, through its trustee Ms Ram, granted tenancy of the premises \\\\nto the Occupants/Tenants, as members of her family. Ms Ram kept some \\\\nof her possessions at the premises and occupied a bedroom when she \\\\nwas at home. She also intended to live with the Occupants/Tenants as a \\\\nfamily unit on a more full-time basis in the future. \\\\n\\\\n8. Section 10 of the Act states:\\\\n\\\\n“Where, in any proceedings before the Tribunal, any party contends that this Act \\\\ndoes not apply in respect of any tenancy of any residential premises, it shall be for \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4621351 3\\\\n\\\\nthat party to establish the facts upon which it is contended that this Act does not \\\\napply.”\\\\n\\\\n9. So, in the present case, the Landlord must prove, on the balance of \\\\nprobabilities, that s 5(1)(n) applies. This requires the landlord to prove that \\\\nMs Ram is the landlord and owner of the premises, and that Mr Singh and \\\\nMrs Zabeen are members of the landlord\\'s or owner\\'s family.\\\\n\\\\nWho is the landlord or owner of the residential premises\\\\n\\\\n5. A trust is not a separate legal entity, the trustees own the trust assets of any \\\\nfamily trust, for the benefit of the beneficiaries.\\\\n\\\\n6. The trustees of the Trust own the premises. Ms Ram is the settlor of this Trust, \\\\na co-trustee and a beneficiary that has a licence to occupy the premises and \\\\nuse it as her place of residence. She does not have to pay rent if she pays all \\\\nthe outgoings for the premises. As such, she is not a tenant for the purposes of \\\\nthe Act. Although Mr Alan McLean is a co-trustee and a co-owner/landlord of \\\\nthe premises, as Davidson J states in Lothbury Management Ltd v Ryan and \\\\nAnor [2021] NZHC 2621 [1 October 2021] at [45]:\\\\n\\\\n“…where two co-owners agree that the property is to be used by one of them as a \\\\nplace of residence, s5(1)(n) applies, and a residential tenancy governed by the Act is \\\\ndeemed not to exist”.\\\\n\\\\n7. Whether the Occupants/Tenants are covered by the provisions of the Act, or are \\\\ncommon law tenants, depends on whether they are family members of the \\\\nTrustee landlord and legal owner of the premises.\\\\n\\\\nWere the occupants/tenants members of the landlord\\'s or owner\\'s family\\\\n\\\\n8. During the hearing, the parties confirmed that Mr Singh is Ms Ram’s sister’s son \\\\nand her nephew. They are therefore related by blood. The parties also \\\\nconfirmed that Mrs Zabeen is married to Mr Singh and is therefore related to Ms \\\\nRam by marriage.\\\\n\\\\n9. Ms Ram, as a co-trustee/landlord/owner, entered into a verbal agreement for Mr \\\\nSingh and his wife to reside at the premises, in exchange for $400 a week for \\\\nthe first month and $500 per week thereafter.\\\\n\\\\n10. Ms Ram says she entered into this verbal agreement, on the understanding that \\\\nMr Singh and Mrs Zabeen are her family members, one by blood and the other \\\\nby marriage. Further, that they were not tenants but occupants that paid rent \\\\ntowards offsetting the outgoings of the premises, that Ms Ram has responsibility \\\\nfor covering as the holder of a licence to occupy and the main tenant.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4621351 4\\\\n\\\\n11. The Occupants/Tenants argues that they resided in the premises from around \\\\n28 March 2016 to 29 October 2022, and they were tenants as they paid rent as \\\\nwell as outgoings. They also made payments towards the costs of renovating \\\\nthe premises, as well as supplying free labour to carry out the renovations.\\\\n\\\\n12. Ms Ram argues:\\\\n\\\\na The Act does not apply to the Tenants/Occupants occupation of the \\\\npremises because s 5(1)(n) of the Act applies.\\\\n\\\\nb There is no residential tenancy, and therefore, no jurisdiction for the \\\\nTenancy Tribunal to hear this matter.\\\\n\\\\nc Both occupants are members of the landlord\\'s or owner\\'s family, \\\\ninvoking the s 5 exclusion because:\\\\n\\\\ni Mr Lalit Singh is Ms Ram’s sister’s son, a nephew and \\\\ntherefore a blood relative; and\\\\n\\\\nii Mrs Musarat Zabeen is Mr Lalit Singh’s wife and is therefore \\\\nrelated to Ms Ram by marriage. \\\\n\\\\nd Further, Ms Ram made clear to the Occupants/Tenants that there \\\\nwas no binding tenancy agreement between them and the Trust \\\\nwhen the Occupants/Tenants asked for tenancy agreement in April \\\\n2016. She did so in her character reference letter, dated 28 April \\\\n2016, stating that he and his wife were not tenants but occupants \\\\nthat paid rent to live in the family home, and they did not have a \\\\nresidential tenancy with the Trust because:\\\\n\\\\ni Mr Singh is her “nephew”, “beneficiary” and “agent for the \\\\nrental property”;\\\\n\\\\nii “Mr Singh and his wife moved into our family home on 21 \\\\nMarch with me and will continue to reside there until I return \\\\nto New Zealand in a few months’ time”;\\\\n\\\\niii “Since the changes to my family Trustees, we as Permila \\\\nRam Trust has agreed not to have rental properties but \\\\nfamilies to live in them”;\\\\n\\\\niv “I intend to relive in my house 18 Cambourne Road from July \\\\n2016 with my adopted son/nephew Lalit Singh and his wife \\\\nMusarat Zabeen as a family unit”.\\\\n\\\\n10. The parties agreed at the hearing that Mr Singh and his wife are members of \\\\nthe landlord\\'s or owner\\'s family, as required for the section 5(1)(n) exception in \\\\nthe Act to apply. Therefore, the Occupants/Tenants claim that they were \\\\ntenants that are covered by the provisions of the Act must fail.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4621351 5\\\\n\\\\nConclusion\\\\n\\\\n11. The Tenancy Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear this matter and \\\\naccordingly the claim is struck out for want of jurisdiction.\\\\n\\\\n12. The Occupants/Tenants have not been wholly or substantially successful \\\\nin their application. Therefore, their application for reimbursement of the \\\\nfiling fee is denied.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nM Pollak\\\\n\\\\n27 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4621351 6\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression \\\\norders apply around publication of this decision. \\\\n\\\\n2. Samuel Smits must pay Fordyce Realty Limited As Agent For Ashleigh Lowe \\\\n$1,913.50 immediately, calculated as shown in table below.\\\\n\\\\nDescription Landlord\\\\nRent arrears to 26/8/2023 after bond refunded $165.71\\\\nFiling fee reimbursement $20.44\\\\nRepairs: front door $207.00\\\\nRepairs: other including rubbish removal $664.90\\\\nBreak lease fee $555.45\\\\nGate replacement $300.00\\\\nTotal award $1,913.50\\\\nTotal payable by Tenant to Landlord $1,913.50\\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. The landlord attended the hearing represented by Mr Fordyce. The tenant did \\\\nnot attend.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4661529 2\\\\n\\\\n2. The tenancy commenced on 9 April 2023 for a fixed term of one year but was \\\\nended early at the tenant’s request. The premises were retenanted from 27 \\\\nAugust 2023. \\\\n\\\\n3. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, compensation, and reimbursement of \\\\nthe filing fee following the end of the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\nHow much is owed for rent ?\\\\n\\\\n4. When a fixed term tenancy is broken, the tenant is liable for rent to the date the \\\\npremises were retenanted..  The landlord provided rent records of the rent due \\\\nto 26 August 2023. The bond has been refunded leaving arrears of $165.71 \\\\nowing. \\\\n\\\\nDid the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?\\\\n\\\\n5. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean \\\\nand tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all \\\\nchattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential \\\\nTenancies Act 1986\\\\n\\\\n6. The tenant did not remove all rubbish.\\\\n\\\\n7. The amounts ordered are proved.\\\\n\\\\nIs the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?\\\\n\\\\n8. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy \\\\nand is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the \\\\ntenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the \\\\ndamage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their \\\\npermission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.\\\\n\\\\n9. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord\\'s \\\\ninsurance, the tenant\\'s liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or \\\\nfour weeks\\' rent (or four weeks\\' market rent in the case of a tenant paying \\\\nincome-related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  \\\\n\\\\n10. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord\\'s insurance, \\\\nthe tenant\\'s liability is limited to four weeks\\' rent (or market rent).  See section \\\\n49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the \\\\ntenant\\'s conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the \\\\ndamage.  See section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n11. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which \\\\nresults from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This \\\\napplies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are \\\\nresponsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4661529 3\\\\n\\\\n12. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the \\\\nnecessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a \\\\nperson does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage \\\\nis a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.\\\\n\\\\n13. The following damage was caused during the tenancy:\\\\n\\\\n• Damage to the back and front doors from dog scratches. These required filing \\\\nand repainting;\\\\n\\\\n• The curtains in one room were covered in mould and had to replaced. These \\\\nwere new at the beginning of the tenancy;\\\\n\\\\n• There was blue paint on some of the decking and two large gouges one two \\\\ndecking boards. These boards have been replaced and the paint removed;\\\\n\\\\n• The were deep gouges on one of the bedroom walls that required repair;\\\\n\\\\n• The large wire gate had been badly dented on one side and cannot be repaired. \\\\nIt cannot be opened easily. The Landlord claimed $648.60 for a replacement \\\\ngate, however photographs showed that the gate was far from new and showed \\\\nsigns of rust. I have taken into account depreciation and awarded $300.00 as a \\\\ncontribution towards replacement. \\\\n\\\\n• The landlord claimed for 2 replacement lavender bushes that he believed had \\\\nbeen damaged by a dog. The photographs showed that while there was some \\\\ndamage the plants were alive and with trimming back would regrow. I have \\\\ndeducted $40.00 from the claim.  \\\\n\\\\n14. While I find the damage was not intentional I do find it can be regarded as \\\\ncareless and more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved \\\\nliability for the damage.\\\\n\\\\n15. The amounts ordered are proved.\\\\n\\\\nCan expenses on lease break be awarded?\\\\n\\\\n16. Where the landlord agrees to an early termination of lease they are entitled to \\\\nclaim any reasonable expenses incurred in this process, including retenanting, \\\\nprovided an itemised account I presented. See s.44A RTA\\\\n\\\\n17. The landlord did present an itemised account of reasonable expenses and that \\\\nclaim is successful. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4661529 4\\\\n\\\\n18. Because Fordyce Realty Limited As Agent For Ashleigh Lowe has substantially \\\\nsucceeded with the claim I have reimbursed the filing fee.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nJ Robson\\\\n\\\\n28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4661529 5\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal \\\\norders suppression of the Tenant and Landlords’ names and identifying details.\\\\n\\\\n2. The applications are dismissed.\\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. Both parties attended the hearing.\\\\n\\\\n2. Each of the parties have brought an application against the other.\\\\n\\\\n3. The tenant’s application concerns his claim that he has been harassed by the \\\\nlandlords.\\\\n\\\\n4. The landlords seek a series of work orders requiring the tenant to repair the \\\\ndamage that the tenant’s dog “F” has caused to both the inside and outside of \\\\nthe premises.\\\\n\\\\nThe tenant’s claim\\\\n\\\\n5. Section 38(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that a landlord \\\\nshall not cause or permit any interference with the reasonable peace, comfort, \\\\nor privacy of the tenant in the use of the premises. Contravention of s38(2) in \\\\ncircumstances that amount to harassment is an unlawful act.\\\\n\\\\n6. The tenant stated that the landlords had harassed him by:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4544892 2\\\\n\\\\n•  inspecting the premises two days after he had broken his leg and then \\\\nadvising him of various ‘issues’ in relation to that inspection; and\\\\n\\\\n• Threatening to terminate his tenancy because he had not repaired the \\\\ndamage to the premises as per a 14 day notice issued to him dated 4 May \\\\n2023 and in an email dated 30 July 2023.\\\\n\\\\n7. I am dismissing the tenant’s claim because neither of these two actions support \\\\nhis contention that he was being harassed. The tenant had allowed the \\\\ninspection and the landlords were legally entitled to point out any issues in \\\\nrelation to that inspection.  Further, there is no evidence that when the tenant \\\\nhad not repaired the damage to the premises as required by the 14 day notice, \\\\nthere was a threat to terminate his tenancy.\\\\n\\\\nThe landlords’ claim\\\\n\\\\n8. It was acknowledged by both parties at today’s hearing that the tenant was \\\\nresponsible for repairing any damage done by F or any other dog or person he \\\\nhad allowed onto the property.  The landlords sought work orders for the tenant \\\\nto undertake these repairs.\\\\n\\\\n9. I am dismissing the claim for work orders because the general understanding is \\\\nthat tenants are to return the premises to the landlord in a reasonable condition \\\\nat the end of the tenancy.  There is no obligation to undertake repairs during the \\\\ntenancy.\\\\n\\\\n10. I also explained s40(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986.  That section \\\\nprovides that a tenant shall not intentionally or carelessly damage, or permit any \\\\nother person to damage, the premises.\\\\n\\\\n11. At today’s hearing the tenant understood the obligation to repair or pay the cost \\\\nof repairing damages caused by F.  Allowing F to continue damaging the \\\\npremises is seen as intentional damage for which the tenant is liable as \\\\nprovided by s40(2) – his obligation is to stop the damage from continuing.  \\\\n\\\\n12. Although the tenant states that F has largely outgrown his destructive behaviour \\\\nhe acknowledges that F cannot resist chewing the irrigation system which \\\\nmakes it inoperable.  There was an understanding at today’s hearing that the \\\\ntenant will have the irrigation system operational when his tenancy ends and \\\\nthat in the meantime he will undertake to replicate the function of the irrigation \\\\nsystem by hosing the area that the irrigation system covers. \\\\n\\\\nFiling fee reimbursement\\\\n\\\\n13. If a party is wholly or substantially successful in their claim, then the Tribunal \\\\norders the other party to reimburse them the filing fee.  Neither party were \\\\nsuccessful in their claims and so each party must bear their own cost of filing in \\\\nthe Tribunal.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4544892 3\\\\n\\\\nSuppression\\\\n\\\\n14. Section 95A of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that:\\\\n\\\\n(1) The Tribunal may, on the application of any party to the proceedings or on \\\\nits own initiative, having regard to the interests of the parties and to the \\\\npublic interest order that all or part of the evidence given or the name or \\\\nany identifying particulars of any witness or party not be published.\\\\n\\\\n(2) An order may be subject to any conditions that the Tribunal considers \\\\nappropriate.\\\\n\\\\n(3) If a party that has wholly or substantially succeeded in the proceedings \\\\napplies for an order that their name or identifying particulars not be \\\\npublished, the Tribunal must make the order unless the Tribunal considers \\\\nthat publication is in the public interest, or is justified because of the party’s \\\\nconduct or any other circumstances of the case.\\\\n\\\\n15. On my own initiative and after discussion with both parties today, I am ordering \\\\nboth parties’ names to be suppressed.  This is because at today’s hearing I saw \\\\nboth parties trying to resolve the issues between them, and although both \\\\nclaims failed the issues between them were genuine.  I do not consider that \\\\nthere is any public interest in having their names published. \\\\n\\\\nC ter Haar\\\\n12 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4544892 4\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

The tenancy ended on 3 June 2023.  The landlord provided rent records and \\\\nwater rates invoices which prove the amount owing at the end of the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\nIs the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?\\\\n\\\\n4. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy \\\\nand is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the \\\\ntenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the \\\\ndamage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their \\\\npermission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.\\\\n\\\\n5. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord\\'s \\\\ninsurance, the tenant\\'s liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or \\\\nfour weeks\\' rent (or four weeks\\' market rent in the case of a tenant paying \\\\nincome-related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  \\\\n\\\\n6. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which \\\\nresults from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This \\\\napplies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are \\\\nresponsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n7. The following damage was caused during the tenancy: carpets and front door. \\\\nThe damage is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved \\\\nliability for the damage.\\\\n\\\\n8. The amounts ordered are proved. This includes the power reconnection fee \\\\nincurred by the landlord due to the tenant’s non-payment of power charges \\\\nduring their tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nJ Tam\\\\n\\\\n28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4605389 3\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression \\\\norders apply around publication of this decision. \\\\n\\\\n2. Rory Greer, Josh Brandt, Eddy Martin, Murphy Lunjevich, Jackson Willis and \\\\nWil De Geest must pay Propertyscouts Dunedin 2017 Limited As Agent For T \\\\nBarnes $17,760.83 immediately, calculated as shown in table below.\\\\n\\\\n3.

All parties attended the rescheduled hearing, two of the tenants by telephone.\\\\n\\\\n2. This was the third hearing of the compensation claim, the two previous hearings \\\\nbeing on 30/3/ and 1/6/2023 respectively.\\\\n\\\\n3. In addition, on 12/1/2023 the Tribunal made an order relating to this tenancy, for \\\\nrent arrears of $3,325.00 to 19/12/2022. \\\\n\\\\n4. The previous order is incorporated into this order for enforcement purposes.\\\\n\\\\n5. On 18/2/2023 the landlord applied for compensation, refund of the bond, and \\\\nreimbursement of the filing fee following the end of the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n6. The tenancy was for a fixed term from 10/1/2022 to 19/12/2022 at $1,020.00 \\\\nrent per week.\\\\n\\\\nDid the tenants comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?\\\\n\\\\n7. At the end of the tenancy the tenants must leave the premises reasonably clean \\\\nand tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all \\\\nchattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential \\\\nTenancies Act 1986.  The tenant is required to replace worn out smoke alarm \\\\nbatteries during the tenancy.  See section 40(1)(ca) Residential Tenancies Act \\\\n1986. \\\\n\\\\n8. The landlord initially claimed compensation for cleaning of $1,138.00.\\\\n\\\\n9. However, because this account included cleaning after repairs were undertaken \\\\nthe claim was reduced to 10 hours work.\\\\n\\\\n10. Further, the landlord claimed $540.00 for cleaning of the bedroom carpets. \\\\n\\\\n11. In support of the claim the landlord provided entry and inspection reports, with \\\\nphotographs and invoices.\\\\n\\\\n12. In response the tenants disputed that the carpets needed cleaning at the end of \\\\nthe tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n13. I am satisfied from the evidence that the tenants did not leave the premises \\\\nreasonably clean and tidy, and the bedroom carpets required cleaning.\\\\n\\\\n14. Awards have been made for carpet cleaning and 10 hours cleaning of the \\\\nkitchen and bathroom.\\\\n\\\\nAre the tenants responsible for the damage to the premises?\\\\n\\\\n15. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy \\\\nand is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the \\\\ntenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4506733 3\\\\n\\\\ndamage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their \\\\npermission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA. \\\\n\\\\n16. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord\\'s \\\\ninsurance, the tenant\\'s liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or \\\\nfour weeks\\' rent (or four weeks\\' market rent in the case of a tenant paying \\\\nincome-related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  \\\\n\\\\n17. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord\\'s insurance, \\\\nthe tenant\\'s liability is limited to four weeks\\' rent (or market rent).  See section \\\\n49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the \\\\ntenant\\'s conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the \\\\ndamage.  See section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n18. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which \\\\nresults from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This \\\\napplies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are \\\\nresponsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n19. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the \\\\nnecessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a \\\\nperson does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage \\\\nis a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.\\\\n\\\\n20. Due to the extent and type of damage the landlord believed the damage was \\\\nintentional.\\\\n\\\\n21. Moreover, the landlord is unable to obtain insurance for the premises.\\\\n\\\\n22. Based on the invoices from the builder who undertook the work, which included \\\\nthe costs of the electrical and gib stopping contractors the landlord sought \\\\ncompensation of $21,990.47.\\\\n\\\\n23. Further the landlord claimed $575.00 for replacement of the dishwasher and \\\\n$4,440.00 loss of rent for the time taken to complete the work on the premises.\\\\n\\\\n24. During the hearing the landlord reduced the claim for loss of rent to two weeks \\\\nbecause the time taken included work on another flat in the same complex. \\\\n\\\\n25. The builder who undertook the work appeared and gave evidence about the \\\\nextensive damage to walls, doors, the heat pump, dishwasher and flooring in \\\\nthe kitchen/lounge. \\\\n\\\\n26. The witness also explained his invoices and suggested that all the work \\\\nundertaken on the premises was not charged for, in particular the damage to \\\\nthe external wall in October.\\\\n\\\\n27. I am persuaded by the evidence provided, including the witness and \\\\nphotographs that significant damage was caused to the premises during the \\\\ntenancy. This included holes in walls and doors, the heat pump removed from \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4506733 4\\\\n\\\\nthe wall, the dishwasher was damaged and flooring in the kitchen/lounge had to \\\\nbe replaced.  \\\\n\\\\n28. The damage is more than fair wear and tear. \\\\n\\\\n29. Although the tenants did not dispute most of the damage, they were unhappy \\\\nwith the amount being claimed.\\\\n\\\\n30. In making an award I have taken into account betterment and depreciation.\\\\n\\\\n31. The landlord should be returned to the position they would have been in had the \\\\ntenants not breached their obligations and should not be better or worse off.  \\\\n\\\\n32. In calculating depreciation, I have considered the age and condition of the items \\\\nat the start of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan and the \\\\nacknowledgement of both the landlord and witness that the premises had been \\\\nremedied to a higher standard, using more industrial materials, than previously.\\\\n\\\\n33. As Propertyscouts Dunedin 2017 Limited As Agent For T Barnes has wholly \\\\nsucceeded with the claim I must award the filing fee.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nJ Wilson\\\\n\\\\n28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4506733 5\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

The agent Ms Bhatt attended the hearing for the landlord. There was no \\\\nappearance by the tenants.\\\\n\\\\n2. This tenancy was a fixed term tenancy from 21 June 2022 to 26 June 2023. The \\\\ntenants moved out on 15 May 2023. \\\\n\\\\n3. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, electricity owing, compensation for \\\\nunblocking drain, cleaning, carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, repairs to window \\\\nand walls, rubbish removal and reimbursement of the filing fee following the end \\\\nof the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n4. The bond of $2900.00 was refunded recently by consent.\\\\n\\\\nHow much is owed for rent and electricity?\\\\n\\\\n5. The landlord provided rent records which prove the amount owing at the end of \\\\nthe tenancy. From 11 April to 15 May 2023, there was $1,812.50 owing which \\\\nincluded water. From 16 May to 2 June 2023, there was $1,684.26 owing which \\\\nexcluded water.\\\\n\\\\n6. The landlord accepts there is a credit owing to the tenant for water usage. The \\\\nagent has calculated that actual water usage throughout the tenancy was \\\\n$988.49. The tenant paid $3,280 during the tenancy ($70 per week) as it was \\\\nincluded in the rent amount.\\\\n\\\\n7. The landlord also received the electricity bills in their name. This was passed to \\\\nthe tenants regularly for payment. The tenants have not paid $563.50 electricity \\\\nthat is remaining.\\\\n\\\\n8. The amounts sought have been clarified by the agent, confirmation there was \\\\nno double charges, and to the benefit of the tenant.\\\\n\\\\nDid the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?\\\\n\\\\n9. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean \\\\nand tidy (including lawn/garden) and remove all rubbish.  See section \\\\n40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential Tenancies Act 1986.  \\\\n\\\\n10. The tenant did not leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not \\\\nremove all rubbish.\\\\n\\\\n11. The agent said the premises had seemed to have been abandoned and not \\\\nbeen cleaned and tidied and provided photos. The tenant said they would \\\\nremove their rubbish and belongings but this did not occur despite \\\\narrangements being made. Ultimately the tenant was not contactable, and the \\\\nitems had to be removed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4581313 3\\\\n\\\\n12. The amounts ordered for cleaning, carpet cleaning, lawn tidy and rubbish \\\\nremoval are proved.\\\\n\\\\n13. The landlord claims compensation for unblocking of the toilet drain.\\\\n\\\\n14. It would appear that there was a lot of toilet paper blocking a drain which was \\\\non the outside the house. It is concerning that this wastewater drain is open to \\\\nthe elements. \\\\n\\\\n15. Considering the claim, if there had been other items in the drain, it would be of \\\\nconcern about how the toilet is being used. It is usual to find toilet paper in a \\\\nwaste system. I am not satisfied this was caused by the tenant through ordinary \\\\nuse of a toilet. This claim is dismissed.\\\\n\\\\nIs the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?\\\\n\\\\n16. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy \\\\nand is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the \\\\ntenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the \\\\ndamage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their \\\\npermission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.\\\\n\\\\n17. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which \\\\nresults from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This \\\\napplies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are \\\\nresponsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n18. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the \\\\nnecessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a \\\\nperson does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage \\\\nis a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.\\\\n\\\\n19. The following damage was caused during the tenancy: damage to 2 windows, \\\\nwalls in the 3 bedrooms, lounge and passageway. The agent showed pictures \\\\nof a number of holes on the walls, glue on the master bedroom, strong marks \\\\non the walls. \\\\n\\\\n20. The pre-inspection photos show an older tidy house. \\\\n\\\\n21. The agent says 2 windows had to be repaired and provided an invoice, photos \\\\npre-inspection and post inspection. The amount of $334.88 is awarded for this \\\\nrepair.\\\\n\\\\n22. The agent says the walls and ceiling had been repainted before this tenant \\\\nmoved in. The doors, frames and skirting were aged and not painted. These \\\\nappear to have been of a lower standard. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4581313 4\\\\n\\\\n23. The photos showing the damage to the walls in the bedrooms, lounge and \\\\npassage way is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved \\\\nliability for the damage.\\\\n\\\\n24. The agent proved the Tribunal with 2 quotes they had been provided to repair \\\\nthe damage. The agent also provided an invoice which included an entire \\\\nrepaint of the house. Considering the information and after hearing from the \\\\nagent provided, the Tribunal awards $4500.00 towards the repairs. \\\\n\\\\n25. I have taken into account betterment and depreciation.  The landlord should be \\\\nreturned to the position they would have been in had the tenant not breached \\\\ntheir obligations, and should not be better or worse off.  In calculating \\\\ndepreciation, I have taken into account the age and condition of the items at the \\\\nstart of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan.   \\\\n\\\\n26. Because Rentout Limited As Agent For Lakshmi Narayanan Srinivasan has \\\\nsubstantially succeeded with the claim I have reimbursed the filing fee.\\\\n\\\\n27. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression \\\\norders apply around publication of this decision. \\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nS Singh\\\\n\\\\n28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4581313 5\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.

The landlord attended the hearing. The tenant did not appear.\\\\n\\\\n2. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, compensation and reimbursement of \\\\nthe filing fee following the end of the tenancy. The bond was refunded by a \\\\nprevious order from the Tribunal for rent arrears.\\\\n\\\\n3. The tenancy started on 31 December 2021 and ended on 1 June 2023. The \\\\ntenant was given an extra week to attend to the cleaning, and the rent for this \\\\nweek is claimed.\\\\n\\\\n4. The premises were a small 2 bedroomed unit.\\\\n\\\\n5. The claim for compensation for lighting was withdrawn.\\\\n\\\\nHow much is owed for rent?\\\\n\\\\n6. The tenant left the premises on 8 June 2023.  The landlord provided rent records \\\\nand copies of emails where the tenant agreed to drop the keys off on 8 June 2023 \\\\nafter spending an extra week there after the tenancy ended.\\\\n\\\\nDid the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?\\\\n\\\\n7. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean \\\\nand tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all \\\\nchattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential \\\\nTenancies Act 1986.  \\\\n\\\\n8. The tenant did not leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not \\\\nremove all rubbish in the recycling bins. There were also some larger items \\\\nremoved and destroyed.  This was a small premises and the amount claimed for \\\\nhalf cleaning costs, oven clean and carpet clean is awarded. Photographs \\\\nsupplied support the claims.\\\\n\\\\n9. The tenant did not return the keys. \\\\n\\\\n10. The following chattels were missing at the end of the tenancy: The heat pump \\\\nremote, blinds in the kitchen and curtains in two bedrooms. \\\\n\\\\n11. The amounts ordered are proved.\\\\n\\\\nIs the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?\\\\n\\\\n12. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy \\\\nand is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the \\\\ntenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4615532 3\\\\n\\\\ndamage. Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their \\\\npermission. See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.\\\\n\\\\n13. Where the damage is careless, and occurs after 27 August 2019, section 49B \\\\nRTA applies. If the landlord becomes aware of the damage after 27 August, the \\\\ndamage is presumed to have occurred after that date unless the tenant proves \\\\notherwise. \\\\n\\\\n14. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord\\'s \\\\ninsurance, the tenant\\'s liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or \\\\nfour weeks\\' rent (or four weeks\\' market rent in the case of a tenant paying income-\\\\nrelated rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  \\\\n\\\\n15. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord\\'s insurance, \\\\nthe tenant\\'s liability is limited to four weeks\\' rent (or market rent).  See section \\\\n49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the tenant\\'s \\\\nconduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the damage.  See \\\\nsection 49B(3A)(a) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n16. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which \\\\nresults from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This \\\\napplies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are \\\\nresponsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.\\\\n\\\\n17. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the \\\\nnecessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a \\\\nperson does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage \\\\nis a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.\\\\n\\\\n18. The following damage was caused during the tenancy: 2 holes in a door and wall, \\\\nand a damaged window stay.\\\\n\\\\n19. The holes were in bedroom 1 and there had been an attempt to fix them. The \\\\ntenant did not attend the hearing to explain the damages. I find this intentional \\\\ndamage. \\\\n\\\\n20. There were 2 window stays claimed but only evidence that one was there at the \\\\nstart of the tenancy. This one had been damaged and the window was unable to \\\\nbe used.\\\\n\\\\n21. The damage is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved \\\\nliability for the damage.\\\\n\\\\n22. The amounts ordered are proved.\\\\n\\\\n23. I have taken into account betterment and depreciation.  The landlord should be \\\\nreturned to the position they would have been in had the tenant not breached \\\\ntheir obligations, and should not be better or worse off.

An application for suppression has been made in this case but no order is \\\\nmade.\\\\n\\\\n2.  Jenny Elaine Searle (Hubert) and James Andrew Hubert to pay Gold Property \\\\nManagement Limited as agent for Julie Sinukaban $2,099.46 from the bond, \\\\ncalculated as shown in table below: \\\\n\\\\nDescription Landlord Tenant\\\\n\\\\nCleaning (consent) $654.67  \\\\nRubbish removal (reduced) $1,184.35  \\\\nCarpet cleaning (consent) $240.00  \\\\nFiling fee reimbursement $20.44  \\\\nTotal award $2,099.46  \\\\nBond $2,099.46 $300.54\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4631549 2\\\\n\\\\n3.

The landlord’s application for rent arrears is withdrawn.\\\\n\\\\n5. The tenants’ application is dismissed.\\\\n\\\\nReasons:\\\\n\\\\n1. Both parties attended the hearing. Mr Christiansen represented the landlord.\\\\n\\\\nThe landlord’s application\\\\n\\\\n2. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, compensation, refund of the bond, \\\\nand reimbursement of the filing fee following the end of the tenancy.\\\\n\\\\n3. The landlord withdrew the application for rent arrears ($85.71).\\\\n\\\\n4. The tenant accepted the landlord’s claims for cleaning and carpet cleaning. I \\\\nhave allowed those claims by consent.\\\\n\\\\n5. After hearing the tenants’ evidence, the landlord reduced the claim for rubbish \\\\nremoval. I have awarded the reduced amount based on the photographic \\\\nevidence produced and the tenants’ acknowledgment that they did not remove \\\\nall their rubbish.\\\\n\\\\nThe tenants’ application\\\\n\\\\n6. The tenants have applied for compensation for alleged breaches by the owner \\\\nof the premises in relation to the sleepout and the caravan at the premises.\\\\n\\\\n7. The tenants seek compensation because they say a caravan was provided as \\\\npart of the tenancy but was unliveable, and the sleepout was unconsented and \\\\ntherefore unlawful for use.\\\\n\\\\n8. The tenancy started on 2 May 2022. The tenancy agreement is between the \\\\nowner of the premises and the tenants.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4631549 3\\\\n\\\\n9. The owner’s agent Gold Property Management Ltd (GPML) only became the \\\\nlandlord on 9 June 2022. Mr Christiansen gave evidence that the old caravan \\\\non site was not included in the tenancy agreement nor was it part of the \\\\nmanagement agreement between the owner and her agent.\\\\n\\\\n10. Generally, an agent is not liable in law for the actions of its principle. So, GPML \\\\nis not liable for any alleged breaches by the owner who was the landlord when \\\\nthe tenancy started.\\\\n\\\\n11. The tenants’ claims in relation to the caravan and the sleepout date to the \\\\ncommencement of the tenancy. If the sleepout was unlawful then, the claim \\\\nmust be made against the landlord at the time – the owner.\\\\n\\\\n12. The tenants can pursue a claim against the owner of the premises for breaches \\\\nthat they allege occurred at the start of the tenancy, but not against GPML.\\\\n\\\\n13. I have therefore dismissed the tenants’ application against GPML.\\\\n\\\\n14. On the landlord’s successful application I have reimbursed the Tribunal filing \\\\nfee.\\\\n\\\\nName suppression\\\\n\\\\n15. The landlord did not seek a name suppression order.\\\\n\\\\n16. The tenants sought name suppression. They are not entitled to a name \\\\nsuppression order because their application is unsuccessful, and they accepted \\\\nmost of the landlord’s claims – see section 95A Residential Tenancies Act \\\\n1986.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\nJ Greene\\\\n\\\\n28 September 2023\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n__________________________________________________________________________________\\\\n4631549 4\\\\n\\\\nPlease read carefully:\\\\nVisit justice.govt.nz/tribunals/tenancy/rehearings-appeals for more information on rehearings \\\\nand appeals.\\\\n\\\\nRehearings\\\\nYou can apply for a rehearing if you believe that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice \\\\nhas happened.
