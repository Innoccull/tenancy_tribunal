{"0": {"question": "What are some tips for complaining effectively?", "answer": "When something goes wrong it can be hard to know how to handle it, but we have some tips for how to complain effectively.Eleven steps to complaining effectively\u00a01. Know your rights.\u00a0Do you know what your legal rights are in this matter? Find this out before you go back, so you can complain confidently.\u00a0We can help you\u00a0understand your rights.2. If possible, go back and talk to the person you dealt with in the first place. It is not always practical to do this, but generally it is a good idea to go back and talk with them.\u00a0Sometimes the problem might be just the result of a misunderstanding or an honest mistake that could be put right straight away.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Do not delay. Act now before you forget the important stuff.\u00a0Also, there may be a time limit for making a complaint.\u00a04. Be reasonable when asking for the situation to be \"put right\". Your request is most likely to be granted if it is fair, and proportionate to the problem you have.5. Collect the evidence and have it with you e.g. the faulty product, quote, receipt, or contract. Make notes of what happened and keep a paper trail until the issue is resolved. That way you do not have to rely on your memory and can back up your case.6. Prepare your approach. Practise what you are going to say. Consider taking along a friend for emotional support. Pick someone who is calm and can keep you calm too.7. Keep your cool. Keeping calm and polite will get you further. If the other party tries to engage you in an argument\u00a0you can either ask to speak to the manager/supervisor instead, or go away and investigate the other channels for addressing your complaint.8. It is usually best to escalate the issue within the business/organisation first, if that is an option.\u00a0If talking to the person you dealt with in the first place does not help, ask to talk to their senior (team leader/supervisor/manager). If this does not resolve the matter, ask them to link you with the relevant complaints service. If that does not work you may need to\u00a0 escalate the complaint\u00a0to a third party.9. Make sure the other party can contact you if necessary. If the person (or their senior) is going to follow up your complaint and get back to you later, make sure they have your contact details, and make sure that you have their contact details and ask for reference number if possible.10. Get their decision in writing if you can\u00a0- even\u00a0if it was\u00a0made over the phone. This will help you if you have to dispute anything or take things further.11. Writing a formal letter of complaint can help. If talking with the other party does not sort out the problem, putting your complaint in writing can help by adding weight to your complaint. Even if it does not change their minds, it is a useful summary of the facts if you want to take your complaint further\u00a0- and sometimes a formal letter is required for the next stage in the complaints process.\u00a0  Print "}, "1": {"question": "What is mediation?", "answer": "If you and another person or organisation (the \u201cparties\u201d in the dispute) cannot agree on an issue, and it is not appropriate to\u00a0take the matter\u00a0to the\u00a0Disputes Tribunal, you can use mediation to help resolve it.Mediation is when the parties in dispute meet together (usually either in person or over the phone), helped by an impartial, trained mediator, and try to come to a mutual agreement.What does the mediator do?The mediator is not an advocate for either party. They are a trained, independent and impartial person who helps the parties to reach agreement.During mediation, the mediator helps the parties to:encourage both parties discuss the issues\ndefine the issues\nthink about possible solutions and\nfind a solution which suits both parties.\nThe mediator tries to make sure the parties treat each other politely (for example, allowing each other to speak without interruption). They do not give advice about the issue in dispute, and they do not decide on the solution.Specialist mediation servicesFor some types of disputes, you can get mediation from a specialist mediation service (for example, employment mediation).

The tangata whenua stand by the marae.The kaikaranga of the tangata whenua (the woman who will karanga for the hosts) begins the karanga, an exchange of calls with the kaikaranga for the manuhiri (the woman who will karanga for the manuhiri and lead them to the marae at\u0113a). At the same time, the kaikaranga for the manuhiri leads them slowly and silently\u00a0to the marae at\u0113a about 20-30 metres\u00a0in front of the wharenui (meeting house).\u00a0When the manuhiri reach the marae at\u0113a, there is a short period of silence which acknowledges those who have passed on.Then the tangata whenua will sit on the right of the wharenui, with the men in the front seats and the women and children behind. When the manuhiri reach their seats facing the tangata whenua, they remain standing until the kaik\u014drero of the tangata whenua signals to them that they may sit.After everyone is seated the whaik\u014drero (formal speeches) begin.

This is often - but not always - done by placing it on the marae in front of the visitors. The kaikaranga for the tangata whenua will give a call of thanks while the koha is accepted by a man from the host side.This is followed by hongi (the pressing of noses, and often foreheads) and harir\u016b (shaking hands); the tapu has been removed from the manuhiri and they are now considered part of the tangata whenua.

", "answer": "A Fencing Notice is a formal proposal to your neighbour which describes the fencing work you would like done (the cost of which you want your neighbour to contribute to). You can use a Fencing Notice if you've already tried and failed to reach an agreement with your neighbour.The Fencing Notice has to specify the boundary along which work is to be done, the nature of the work (e.g. building a new fence or repairing an existing one, and what it will look like) and the materials to be used. The notice has to state an estimate of the cost of the work, and how those costs are to be shared (if you propose that they aren't shared equally).It must also tell your neighbour that they have 21 days to object, and that if they don't object within this period they will be deemed to have consented to the work.You can download a sample Fencing Notice from the NZ Legislation website.  Print "}, "51": {"question": "What can I do if I object to my neighbour's Fencing Notice? ", "answer": "If your neighbour has given you a Fencing Notice, you have 21 days to make an objection. For example, you could object because you think the existing fence is adequate, or because your neighbour\u2019s proposed new fence is too expensive.To make an objection to the Fencing Notice, give your neighbour a cross-notice. The cross-notice should outline your objections and suggest any counter-proposals (for example, to use different materials, make the fence taller or lower, or to not build a new one at all).If you and your neighbour cannot agree on the boundary fence, you can:try to resolve\u00a0the matter through mediation\u00a0(if you are both willing to participate) or\neither of you can apply to the Disputes Tribunal or District Court\u00a0for a decision.\nIf you disagree with a Fencing Notice it is important you do not ignore it, as this implies that you agree with what it proposes.

", "answer": "If the work was urgent and your neighbour was not able to contact you about it (for example the fence was damaged in a storm and you have been out of town), then your neighbour can proceed with the work and tell you about it as soon as they are able to. However, if your neighbour had to urgently replace an existing fence, the new one has to be similar to the old one.For non-urgent fencing work \u2013 whether it is building a new one or repairing an existing one \u2013 then under the Fencing Act, your neighbour is required to discuss with you\u00a0the work they want done. If there is disagreement about the fencing work to be done, your neighbour has to give you a Fencing Notice\u00a0if they still want to build the fence.If your neighbour did not notify you before building the boundary fence (and it was not urgent) then you can refuse to pay towards the cost of the fence. You can also object to the new fence\u00a0in the Disputes Tribunal\u00a0or District Court\u00a0(for example, to get an order to dismantle the fence). However as you and your neighbour have to live next to each other it\u2019s best to try to come to an agreement about the fence before it gets this far.

Like state schools, they are governed by boards of trustees.\nUnlike state schools, integrated schools are allowed to restrict enrolment.

A nanny can provide your child with early childhood education (ECE) (if they are licenced\u00a0to provide ECE services or they are with an agency that is licenced), or just look after your child for short periods (eg, for a couple of hours in the evening a few times per week).

The carer belongs to a licenced home-based ECE service, and the organisation supports them through a qualified coordinator with ECE certification.\nOrganisations and agencies providing home-based ECE\nOrganisations that are licenced to provide home-based ECE (whether through nannies or in-home carers) must do police checks on their carers before they will take them on, and the carers are usually required to have specific training, qualifications and skills.

", "answer": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic payments and direct debits are both ways to set up regular payments for things like rent and power.\u00a0\nIt is a good idea to time an automatic payment or direct debit so that it occurs soon after the date you would receive your wages or salary, to ensure there is enough money in the account for the payment to proceed. Once the automatic payment or direct debit is in place, it is worth checking your bank statements regularly, to make sure it is being processed as you intended.\nAutomatic payments\nAn automatic payment is a regular payment you can arrange with your bank. You specify which bank account the payment will be made from, the amount to be paid, and how often the payment will be made (eg a specific date each month). You would normally set up an automatic payment if the payment amount will always be the same, for example your rent payments.\nIf there isn\u2019t enough money in your account to cover an automatic payment, then the payment will not proceed - and your bank may charge you a penalty fee - check their terms and conditions.\nYou can amend or cancel an automatic payment at any time via online banking or by contacting your bank.\nDirect debit\nA direct debit is where you you sign an authority form which gives an organisation the authorisation to deduct money from your account at regular intervals. Direct debits are a common way for people to make regular payments of varying amounts (for example, to pay your electricity bill if you are charged according to use rather than a fixed amount).\nMany people do not realise that direct debit payments can be withdrawn from your account even when there is not enough money in the account. If this happens the bank will probably charge you an overdraft or \u201chonour\u201d fee. If for some reason the payment does not go through, the bank is likely to dishonour the payment and charge you a fee.\nIt is important to know that if you cancel the service that you are paying for via direct debit, you need to check that the direct debit is also cancelled. The service provider should do this for you, but if they don\u2019t then you will need to.\nMore about direct debits is on the Banking Ombudsman website.\nThe Consumer Protection website has information about direct debits and automatic payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Print "}, "476": {"question": "I have had money removed from the bank by direct debit, but I have not signed any forms.

If you did not give authorisation for the debit, you should ask the bank to cancel the direct debit and to help you find out who has been receiving the money. If the direct debit transaction is unauthorised, the business should return the amount to you after your bank has completed a dispute investigation \u2013 this is called a \"chargeback\".

Ideally, pay off the whole amount each month. Read about why it is unwise to only pay the minimum amount.\nKeep your credit limit low so you avoid accidentally using more credit than you can repay. Read about what to do if your credit card limit is too high.\nResearch your credit card options. You may be able to switch to another type of credit card that has less fees or lower interest charges.\nMake extra repayments if you can\nIf you have money to spare, use it to make extra debt repayments. If you have more than one debt, put any extra money into the debt with the highest interest rate.\nDebt consolidation might be helpful\nIf you have several debts, it might be useful to consolidate them (called debt consolidation). This is where all of your debts are grouped together so you only have one regular repayment to make each week, fortnight or month.\nOften the interest rate for a consolidate loan works out as less than the combined interest for the separate debts. However, you need to check with the debt consolidation provider (asking lots of questions) to make sure it is worth doing.\nRead more about\u00a0debt consolidation.\nMore information\nMore information is on:\nthe Sorted website\u00a0\nthe MoneyHub website\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n  Print "}, "495": {"question": "What is child support?

Mental illness can refer to a wide range of conditions that affect your mood, thinking and behaviour.\nExamples of mental illness include depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), psychosis, perinatal depression and addictive behaviours. If these ongoing symptoms become more severe, you may meet the definition of having a mental disorder, which is a legal definition.\nA mental disorder shares the same qualities as a mental illness but is used in reference to the Mental Health Act to describe the particular symptoms a person has.\nThe Mental Health (Compulsory Assessment and Treatment) Act defines mental disorder as an abnormal state of mind to a degree that it:\nposes a serious danger to the person's own, or others\u2019 health and safety, or\nseriously diminishes the capacity of that person to care for themselves.\nAn \u201cabnormal state of mind\u201d can appear as delusions, or disorders of mood, perception, volition or cognition.

An example of this would be if it allows them to change their location (or their fees, or the type of classes they run) so that it's difficult for members to attend classes - but don't provide any means for their members to terminate their membership without penalty or receive some other benefit as compensation (e.g. lower fees for the rest of the term of the contract).If the dance school will not allow you to terminate the contract and get a refund on the unused portion of your membership, you can complain to the Commerce Commission, on the grounds that the contract contains unfair contract terms.Read more about standard consumer contracts.

Before you sign an employment agreement, make sure you know how to distinguish between the three main\u00a0 employment types: permanent, fixed-term and casual.\nPermanent employee\nIf you are a permanent employee, your employment agreement will have no end date to the period of employment.

Your employment agreement must give a genuine reason why your employment is only for a fixed term. For example, you might be employed to temporarily replace an employee on parental leave.\nDuring the term of your employment you have the same employment rights and responsibilities as a permanent employee.\nA fixed-term or seasonal employee can be full-time or part-time.\nPart-time vs full-time\u00a0\nThese terms describe the number of hours you regularly work, and are not employment types.\nGenerally, you are full-time if you work 35-40 hours per week, or part-time if you work fewer hours than this.

If you do not take steps to protect it from being used by someone else it could damage your business\u2019s reputation and profit.\nThe first thing you can do is to check whether your intellectual property rights really are being infringed upon. For example, check your Companies Office registration is still current.\nGenerally, a dispute over the use of a business name would be settled through taking legal action, so your first step would be to get legal advice about the matter, and decide whether it is worth pursuing it in court.\nTrade marked business name\nIf you have protected your business\u2019s name by registering it as a trade mark, you can ask your lawyer to send the other party a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter, and if this does not work you can take them to court to enforce your exclusive rights to the use of the business name.\nThe enforcement of trade marks is covered by the Trade Marks Act 2002.\nNon-trade marked business name\nIf your business name was not registered as a trade mark, you could consider taking the matter to court on the grounds that another business using the same (or very similar) name would be misleading\u00a0(under the Fair Trading Act). How successful this will be, will rely on your being able to show the court that your business is already well established in the area where the other party is operating, and that consumers could be misled into believing the other party\u2019s business is associated with yours.\nIt is a good idea to get legal advice if you are considering taking legal action.\nCompany Name\nNote that if your business is a company, registering the company name with the Companies Office prevents another company from being registered with the same name or one that is very similar. However, it will not prevent another business from\u00a0trading under\u00a0that name (eg, a business that is not a company).\nDomain names\nIf you do not own the rights to domain names that go with your business name you cannot stop someone else from using those domain names.

Initial investigationYour employer should do some initial investigations first, to verify that there is an issue.2. Notify the employeeIf your employer decides there is a misconduct issue, they need to notify you about it in writing. It should include details of what process the employer will follow and tell you that you will be able to give feedback on the process. It should also state what the consequences might be for you (eg, dismissal).Depending on the seriousness of the allegation, they could decide to suspend you while an investigation is being conducted (or asked to take garden leave, an informal alternative to suspension).3. Investigate the allegationThe employer must next investigate the allegation.4. Formal meetingIf, as a result of the investigation, your employer considers you are guilty of misconduct or serious misconduct, they should invite you to a formal meeting (sometimes called a disciplinary meeting) and do so in writing. The letter should state what the misconduct or serious misconduct is, including the evidence and any investigation report and witness statements. It should also say that you can bring a support person with you to the meeting.At the meeting the employer will explain what the allegation is and any evidence that there is to support it, and you will have the opportunity to respond to the allegation by telling your side.Support person for the disciplinary meetingIf you belong to a union it is well worth contacting them as soon as you receive the notice. They can provide advice to help you prepare for the meeting and may be able to help you find a suitable support person. A support person could be a union representative, lawyer, friend or family member.

An estimate can be useful if you just want a rough idea of the cost.A quote is an offer from the business to do a job at a certain price.

Make sure you ask for a quote in writing so that if a problem arises you have a record of your agreement with the trader.A written quote should include what work is to be done, the hourly rate for labour and how long it will take, and the cost of materials. It should also say how long the quote is valid for.

This is different to trial periods, which can only be used for new employees.A probation period, like the\u202ftrial period, must be recorded in the employment agreement and must be agreed by both parties.\u202fThis includes stating how long the probation period will last.In both trial periods and probation periods, the employee must be paid for the hours they work.A probation period should only be long enough for the employee to demonstrate their suitability for the job.DismissalAn employer cannot dismiss a probationary employee without a good reason, and must still follow correct procedure for dismissal. A probationary employee can still raise a personal grievance for unfair dismissal.With a trial period, the employer can dismiss the employee without giving a reason, as long as they give notice within the trial period.More informationRead more about\u00a0probation periods.\u00a0We also have lots more information about trial periods.

However, if you have reason to believe that you have been effectively working as an employee then you could make a claim for all of the minimum employment rights.Some of the factors that might determine that you are effectively an employee include:the kind of work you did as part of your work test was of commercial benefit to the employer e.g. instead of asking you to make the employer a cappuccino to test your barista skills, they asked you to work a complete shift alongside the staff;\nyou were paid for your time or expected to be paid;\nsomething the employer told you led you to believe they had given you a job offer.\nIf you want to be fairly confident that an employer isn't simply trying to get free labour from job applicants, it's worth asking around to get an idea as to whether people who have performed unpaid work tests at that particular business have tended to get employed as a result.If you are not sure what your rights are in a situation like this, contact the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment's workplace contact centre on 0800 20 90 20.

For example, it can be in a specially weighted casket or sewn into a shroud, which is traditionally how sailors were buried at sea. However, a wooden casket might not work as it will tend to float.\nYou will need to arrange a boat or helicopter to transport the body to the burial site.\nBe aware that some cultures - particularly M\u0101ori - consider sea burials culturally inappropriate.\nApplying for a burial at sea\nIf you are using a funeral director, they can do these tasks on your behalf.\nFirst, read their Guide to Burials at Sea in New Zealand\nThe EPA\u2019s Guide to Burials at Sea in New Zealand has information about things like:\nwhere sea burials can legally take place\ngetting permission and\nspecifications for the casket or (other container) for the body.\nApply to the EPA for approval\nAt least three days before the planned sea burial, you need to:\nget a copy of the doctor\u2019s certificate (showing cause of death) or coroner\u2019s authorisation.\ncomplete a \u201cBurial at Sea proposal\".

You can download the proposal form from the EPA website.\nSend the above to the EPA\u2019s EEZ Compliance team, by email or post. The address details are on the EPA website.\nIf the EOA accepts your proposal, they will issue you with a certificate of compliance.\nThey will also tell every iwi, hap\u1fe1, customary marine title group, and protected customary rights group, about the planned sea burial.\nSend evidence to the EPA that the sea burial took place as proposed\nWithin 10 days after the sea burial, you or the funeral director must send evidence that the sea burial happened as planned in the proposal. The EPA prefers a video with a time and date stamp, as wells as the latitude and longitude coordinates.\nApplication and processing fee\nYou have to pay a fee to the EPA for assessing your application and processing your certificate of compliance. How much you have to pay depends on how long it takes them to do the work.

These can be harmful to your skin, airways and the environment, but are effective at removing dirt, grease, stains and mould. Cleaning products tend to also contain chemicals for different purposes other than cleaning ability, for example, perfumes, foaming agents, emulsifiers and preservatives \u2013 and these can also be harmful to some individuals (and possibly the environment).When using strong cleaning products, it is important to follow any accompanying safety precautions \u2013 for example, wear gloves and protective eyewear, keep windows open for ventilation, and store cleaning products out of reach of children.\u00a0Information about staying safe around chemicals in common household products is on the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) website.What makes a cleaning product natural?There are cleaning products which claim to be \"natural\" or \"eco-friendly\", but be aware of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d. Greenwashing is when a product is marketed to make you think it is environmentally safe, when it is only partially true or not true at all. Examples of greenwashing include packaging that is green or displays images of landscapes, and use of words like \u201ceco-friendly\u201d, \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d.If you want to buy a cleaning product that is less likely to cause irritation to your skin or airways, look for a full ingredients list and check for specific ingredients that you know you should avoid. An ingredients list might be on the manufacturer\u2019s website, or you can write to them and ask for it.You could also look for products that are marketed as suitable for sensitive skin, but this is no guarantee that it will not irritate yours.Make your own cleaning productsYou can also try cleaning your home with ingredients which you probably already have in your kitchen. You can expect them to have less impact on your living environment than commercial cleaning products - and they\u202fare generally cheaper to buy. For example, you can use:baking soda to remove stains and eliminate odours from your refrigerator\nwhite vinegar diluted with water (one part vinegar to 5 parts water) to clean bathroom surfaces\nlemon juice mixed with olive oil to polish hardwood furniture\nsalt to soak up red wine spills\ncombine baking soda with castile soap (made from oil) to remove stubborn dirt\nwashing soda (made from citric acid and Epsom salts) for dishwashing and laundry\nThe EPA website has more information about protecting the environment from hazardous chemicals.\u00a0You can find more information about homemade cleaners by searching the Internet or finding books about the topic.

During FDR mediation, you will work with an independent mediator to discuss the issues and try to come to an agreement about the day-to-day care of your children.Going to the Family CourtIf the dispute is still not resolved after completing FDR mediation (or the FDR mediator has determined that mediation is not appropriate in your situation),\u00a0you can apply to the Family Court for a decision. If you or your ex-partner simply change your mind after initially agreeing on a plan during FDR mediation, you may be required to go through FDR mediation again, instead of applying to the Family Court.At any step in this process, if you and your ex-partner reach an agreement about your children\u2019s day to day care, you might consider having the agreement formalised as a consent order.In most cases, you will not be able to apply to the Family Court unless you have already attended a PTS course and attempted resolution through FDR mediation.

PTS is designed to help both parties agree on a solution which is best for their children. Anyone can attend who is in a dispute about child arrangements. The course is run by community providers from funding by the Government, and is free for participants.If you apply to the Family Court to resolve a dispute with your ex-partner or another family member (about the day to day care of your children, or to formalise your parenting agreement) you will most likely need to show that you have completed the PTS course within the last two years. There is an exception if the children are at risk of harm, or you or the other party in the dispute is not able to participate effectively.The PTS course is four hours long and is usually presented as two two-hour sessions. Generally, both parties in the dispute will attend the programme separately, but you can normally bring a support person with you (it would be a good idea to check with your PTS provider first). The course will cover topics such as how separation affects children; the importance of both parents\u2019 support of the children, how to reduce and manage conflict, and communication skills for people in a separated family.To enrol in a PTS course, simply contact a PTS provider near you (they are listed on the Ministry of Justice\u00a0website \u2013 select \u201cParenting Programme\u201d and then select your region) or call the Ministry of Justice Family Justice line 0800 2 AGREE (0800 224 733).When you complete the PTS course you will receive a certificate of completion\u00a0\u2013 if you end up going to court to resolve your dispute, you will need to present this certificate to show the Family Court that you have completed this step.

This process is called assignment.The remaining tenants could be liable for the departing tenant\u2019s share of the rent, if they do not find a replacement tenant.Assignment versus sublettingNote that assigning a tenancy to a new tenant is not the same as subletting, where all of the tenants move out and on-rent it to someone else (eg, if the tenants will be out of town for several months). In this situation the new tenant's contract is with the out-going tenants and the out-going tenants still have a contract with the landlord or property manager.More information about change of tenancy is on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment\u2019s Tenancy website.\u00a0  Print "}, "1371": {"question": "We all jointly signed a tenancy agreement for a flat a few months ago \u2013 but now I want to move out.

Otherwise, the case goes through the judgement by default process (ie, a decision is made even though the other party has not responded to a summons or failed to appear in court). At any point during the civil claim process, you and the other party may resolve the dispute between you and end the claim process.If there is a court hearing and the judge\u2019s decision is in your favour, then the other party can be ordered to pay towards your court costs.You\u2019ll find more information about starting proceedings in the District Court, as well as the forms you\u2019ll need, on the Ministry of Justice website.
