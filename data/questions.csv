"Landlord said he's moving in on Friday","My girlfriend has been renting an apartment with a colleague for 1 month, there is a spare room that has a couch with a TV and desk. This morning their landlord messaged them informing that he has separated from his wife and will need to use the spare room as a bedroom for the foreseeable future but he is willing to reduce the rent to 175 a week (currently 230) or waive the notice period and return bond if they want to move out. The tennacy agreement stipulates maximum occupancy is 2 people. He said he is going to drop his bags off on Friday morning before work. The agreement also stipulates that the landlord cannot enter the premises without permission from the Tennant. In-lieu of calling the police on Friday morning for a home invasion if he goes through with this what can be done?"
"Advice and vent on landlord invading privacy","Yesterday, my missus and I were freshly post coitus when I hear a knock at about 3pm. It’s my landlord so I ignore it. He keeps knocking and then uses his key to get in. We’re scrambling trying to find clothes. He comes in and stands in the lounge and asked to talk while I’m getting dressed. Missus is freaked out that he so conveniently opened the door when we finished. We’re wondering if there’s any recourse? I’m so tired of renting man. Landlords suck. The house isn’t even up to standard."
"Landlord keeps coming onto property","We're in a rental we're there is a locked shed out the back of the property, which we don't have access to and they use to store things. We're renting through an agency, but the owners of the house live within walking distance. There has been multiple incidents we're we've found the owners on the property with no prior notice, and have notified the rental agency of this who said they can't be doing this and will talk to them (They do not speak English, so it's hard for us to communicate with them.) Recently we have found them on the property again, when my young daughter who came out scared because someone was walking outside her room. How do we go about ensuring this does not continue, as we've been here some time now (3 years) and other than that have not had many issues with this rental. Edit: Nothing mentioned on the tenancy agreement, only verbally when we initially took the place that there's a shed we would not have access too. The shed is at the rear of the property, through multiple fenced of sections. Also there is banana trees inside the section which they pick the flowers off?"
"Landlords have put a local candidate election sign on my fence.","As per title I'm not particularly happy about having my landlords impose their chosen candidate on the property we live in. I have just been to have a discussion with my landlords about this and she smirked literally told me they are the home owners. I stood my ground and politely explained I wanted it taken down using political neutral language advising I am not a particularly politically minded person (I actually am but that's none of her business and I wanted to be as neutral as possible emphasising it has nothing to do with the candidate) and would prefer not to have my house having a sign representing a Vote for xxxxx sign. They live next door to us and haven't got his sign on their fence suggested it is placed there. Their fence is concrete so she said it wouldn't be able to be attached. I suggested they could put it on stakes. She smirked again. Advised she'd talk to her husband about it. Anyone know what my rights are here? I advised it does interfere with my right to quiet enjoyment of our property. I'm actually a bit shook up with how much she disregarded my concerns."
"Can a Landlord Complain About Beds Not Being Made?","I feel a little harassed. Should we make a complaint or are our feelings just too fragile? So we (three males all in our thirties) had a flat inspection recently and we ended up getting emailed this: - Hello at the inspection it was reported that the lawns needed to be done.  Please ensure this is always done before the inspection as these reports go the owner. Fair enough. Mind you we used to to them ourselves until she complained about us creating a compost pile of lawn clippings and instructed us that clippings were to be taken off-site. So we hired a lawnmower guy because he takes them away on this truck. A small expense but saves any hassle. He comes every two weeks but he came a day after the inspection so they had been growing almost two weeks I suppose. Just bad timing I guess. Anyway she continues... - Also it was mentioned that the rooms were untidy. They were bloody well not! Untidy in what way exactly? - Please ensure things are off the ground beds are made curtains pulled and rooms are ventilated. I'm not sure because she wasn't specific but I think the first part about stuff being on the ground was my room. I have a couple of piles of books on the ground (due to running out of shelf-space) and also four guitars (two on stands one on the floor leaning against my bookshelf on on the floor leaning against the wall). I also had a small pile of clothes at the foot of my bed that I took off the line before leaving for work I put them in my drawers after arriving home. I doubt it was the other two guys because they went into overdrive to get their rooms looking like a drill sergeant was coming (because they were a bit paranoid after all her complaining last inspection)."
