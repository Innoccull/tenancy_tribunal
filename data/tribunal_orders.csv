RESPONDENT: Barfoot & Thompson Limited - Meadowlands As Agent For 
Cheng Hang
 Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: [Tenancy address suppressed]
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the tenants’ names and identifying details.
2. The tenants are authorised to install a cat door at the premises at their cost. At 
the end of the tenancy (in the absence of an agreement to leave the cat door in 
place) they must remove the cat door and reglaze the glass pane where it was 
installed. The reglazing work must be done by a professional window repairer.
3. The application for compensation for cleaning costs is withdrawn.
4. Barfoot & Thompson Limited – Meadowlands as agent for Cheng Hang must pay 
[The tenant/s].Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing. Mr Xiang represented the landlord.
2. The tenants have applied for an order authorising them to install a cat door at the 
premises and compensation for cleaning costs they incurred at the start of the 
tenancy.
3. The tenants withdrew the compensation claim at the hearing today.
4. Mr Xiang explained that the owner of the premises opposed the tenants installing 
a cat door because he was concerned about the glass pane not being returned 
to its current state and he thought there was a risk of damage.
5. Objectively viewed, the tenants’ request is not unreasonable. The installation of 
a cat door is a minor alteration that would enhance the tenants’ enjoyment of the 
tenancy. 
6. Recent amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 aimed in part at 
allowing tenants to do minor alterations so long as the premises are retuned to 
the state they were in at the start of the tenancy when the tenancy ends.
7. The tenants understand that they will have to remove the cat door when they 
vacate the tenancy and have the glass pane professionally reinstated.
8. The parties may, of course, agree to leave the cat door in place. But in the 
absence of an agreement the tenants must remove it and reinstate the glass pane 
when they vacate.
9. On the successful application, I award the tenants the filing fee.

APPLICANT: Emma Louise Lewis
Tenant
RESPONDENT: Blain Justin Allen
Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: 35 Huratai Street, Koutu, Rotorua 3010
ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision. 
2. Applications dismissed.  
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.
2. The Landlord applied for compensation following the end of the tenancy.
3. The Tenant has cross-applied for compensation also.  
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
4. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all 
chattels provided for their benefit: s 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986 (the Act).  
5. The Landlord claims the Tenant did not leave the premises reasonably clean and 
tidy and did not remove all rubbish.  More particularly, the Landlord says he 
inspected the premises after the Tenant moved out and found the following items 
left behind by her:
a. Beer, wine and bleach bottlesb. Kiwifruit boxes
c. Pie packets and general rubbish
d. Missing curtain netting
e. Greenwaste scattered all over the property including rose cuttings and things 
she has hacked at because she decided they needed to be hacked at.  
f. Dead rose bush
g. BBQ 
h. Carpet
i. Couch 
j. Table 
k. A rainbow of paint and chalk on driveway concrete - pretty much freshly 
chalked/painted.  
6. The Landlord claims time and costs on the following basis:
a. Dump Fees of $90 and approximately $2,160 for three people working three, 
eight-hour days at $30/hour:
i. Removing rubbish and cleaning filthy home;
ii. Removing vivid marks over my fireplace.  
iii. Cleaning grubby doors throughout premises.  Dirty hands.  
iv. Cleaning bath.  
7. The Landlord has very little evidence to back up his claims.  One of the persons 
who allegedly helped him clean the premises is his cousin who attended the 
hearing to give evidence, not on the Landlord’s behalf, but on behalf of the 
Tenant.  Her evidence, as far as I deduced from her written statement, is she 
helped the Tenant clean the premises, and she and the Tenant had worked 
together to remove the Landlord’s personal property from the premises, as 
required by a Work Order made by this Tribunal.     
8. No pre-tenancy or post-tenancy reports have been provided by the Landlord.  He 
says I can rely on his word, but I am not satisfied that I can.  He has provided 
photographs of some of items he says the Tenant left behind, though the Tenant 
denied she left these items behind and indirectly questioned the evidential weight 
of the Landlord’s photographs.  
9. The Landlord’s former property manager wrote a letter in support of the Tenant 
and made herself available for questioning by phone at the hearing.  Her evidence 
in summary was as follows:
a. The premises were checked after the Tenant had moved herself out.    b. No knowledge of wine or beer bottles.  
c. No ingoing inspection/condition report, she was not sure of condition of the 
property at the commencement of the tenancy, having been engaged in 
recent months.  
d. Not aware of any handprints on the front door.  (Walked around property 
outside.)
e. Tenant supplied her own curtain netting.  
f. Some items left behind.   
g. The premises were very reasonably clean and tidy at the end of the tenancy.  
h. Paint on the walls in reasonable condition.  
i. Burn mark on the floor at the end of the tenancy.  
j. Greenspace (yards) were in reasonable condition.  
k. Barbecue was left behind by the Tenant said she would return to collect.  
10. The Tenant confirmed she had left some of her personal property behind at the 
end of the tenancy but had explained to the Landlord’s property manager she 
would be collecting it, which she has now done.  
11. Mr Lewis, an acquaintance of the Tenant, had helped the Tenant move in and 
out of the premises and his evidence aligned with that of the Landlord’s former 
property manager, namely that it was reasonably clean and tidy.  Further, Mr 
Lewis had been inside and around the premises and confirmed the premises 
were in a much better state at the end of the tenancy than they were in at the 
start, when he moved the Tenant in.  
12. Neither witness expressed any concerns about the condition of the premises at 
the end of the tenancy.  
13. The Landlord questioned the Tenant’s witnesses and did not glean any further 
information I would regard as helpful to his case.  
14. At the end of the evidence I was satisfied the Landlord had insufficient evidence 
to support his claims for compensation for rubbish removal, cleaning, loss of 
income (time off work for cleaning, etc.), and mental harm (due to the Tenant 
meddling in his private affairs – addressed in separate proceedings).  
15. The Tenant counter-claimed for compensation for time spent helping the 
Landlord’s cousin remove the Landlord’s property from the premises.  
16. I told the Tenant quite plainly, she did not need to remove the Landlord’s property 
as there was a Tribunal Work Order requiring him to make his own arrangements 
to have it removed, which I could not now enforce against him due to her efforts 
in fulfilling it on his behalf.  I accept the Tenant’s claim that she just wanted the 
property gone and it served her interests to help remove it, however, I am unable to award her any compensation for her efforts because the Landlord had paid his 
cousin to remove his property and had not agreed for the Tenant to be involved 
in this process, and further, the Tribunal had not directed the Tenant to undertake 
the work for payment unless the Landlord did not comply with the Work Order.  
The Work Order did not say the Tenant would be paid if she helped the Landlord 
to comply with the Work Order.  
17. Consequently, I have not awarded compensation to either party and costs lie 
where they fall.

APPLICANT: Chelsea Pearl Collins-Kemp
Tenant
RESPONDENT: Edge Real Estate Limited Michelle Conquer
Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: 17A Harbour Crest Drive, Waiuku, Waiuku 2123
ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision.
2. Bond Services is to release from the Bond the sum of $253.00 to Edge Real 
Estate Limited Michelle Conquer immediately.  
3. Bond Services is to pay the balance of the Bond, $1,907.00 to Chelsea Pearl 
Collins-Kemp immediately.  
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.  
2. The Landlord has applied to be compensated for carpet cleaning and a crack in 
the bathroom vanity at the end of the tenancy.   
3. The Tenant claims compensation for stress due to the Landlord not releasing her 
bond to her.  
4. In terms of the Tenant’s claim, I note the parties have been in dispute regarding 
damage to the premises and have attended mediation.  I do not get the sense 
the Landlord has deliberately withheld the bond to upset the Tenant.  There is a 
genuine dispute between the parties.  
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
5. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all chattels provided for their benefit: s 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986 (RTA).  
6. The Landlord has produced photographs showing the condition of the carpet at 
the commencement of the tenancy and at the end.  
7. The Tenant said she cleaned the carpet herself at the end of the tenancy, but 
professional carpet cleaning was required to restore the carpet, and I note, 
whereas the Tenant was not able to restore the carpet to its pre-tenancy state, 
the professional cleaner has been able to do so and has noted the carpet was 
dirty and appeared not to have been cleaned in some time, despite the Tenant’s 
efforts.  
8. The Tenant has a dog and it is possible the Tenant’s dog has contributed to the 
build-up of dirt on the carpets in the home, but without more information about 
the dog and its activities, I make no firm finding in this regard.  
9. I award the Landlord its costs in having the carpets professionally cleaned.  
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
10. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission: s 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
11. Where the damage is careless, and occurs after 27 August 2019, section 49B 
RTA applies.  If the landlord becomes aware of the damage after 27 August, the 
damage is presumed to have occurred after that date unless the tenant proves 
otherwise.  
12. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord's 
insurance, the tenant's liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or 
four weeks' rent (or four weeks' market rent in the case of a tenant paying income-
related rent): s 49B(3)(a) RTA.  
13. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, 
the tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent).  See section 
49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the tenant's 
conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the damage: s 
49B(3A)(a) RTA.
14. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for: s 49B(1) RTA.
15. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
16. The Landlord claims the vanity was damaged during the tenancy. 
17. The Landlord has failed to establish the damage occurred during the tenancy:
a. There are no pre-tenancy, close-up photographs of the affected area of the 
vanity.  
b. The nature of the damage is such that it could have occurred gradually and 
imperceptibly over time.  
c. There is no reference to the damage in any inspection reports completed 
during the tenancy.  
d. The Tenant has presented a screenshot of one frame from a video she made 
soon after the tenancy began in which the vanity surface can be seen, and 
the crack plainly observed.  The video was not taken for the purposes of 
showing the damage to the vanity, it was a personal video from the Tenant’s 
Snapchat application.  
e. On balance, I find it more likely the crack started as a hairline crack and grew 
larger as the tenancy progressed, but I find it unlikely the crack has been 
caused by the Tenant because it can be plainly seen in the Tenant’s 
screenshot, so soon after the commencement of the tenancy, yet has not 
been noted in the pre-tenancy inspection checklist, nor has it been 
documented by the parties anywhere else until after the tenancy ended.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - 
APPLICANT: Anita Lois Dudley
 Tenant
RESPONDENT: [The respondent/s] 
 Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: [Tenancy address suppressed]
ORDER
1. An order for suppression is made of the Landlord’s name and identifying details.
2. The application is dismissed.
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.
2. This application was filed on 20 March 2023. It relates to a tenancy which 
terminated on 20 July 2015. The applicant claims compensation against the 
landlord for a range of factors, including for failure to return the bond, unfair 
increases in rent, wrongful termination of the tenancy and for the allegedly poor 
condition of the property, including an allegation of mushrooms growing on the 
carpet in the lounge. 
3. As was discussed with the parties at the outset of the hearing, the question of 
jurisdiction arises because of the length of time that has passed between the end 
of the tenancy and the date of the application being filed and also because of the 
fact that this matter has been dealt with previously by the Tribunal. 
Background facts 4. A brief summary of the earlier orders of the Tribunal is as follows: 
a) On 22 July 2015, an order was made granting possession of the premises to 
the landlord. The applicant, who was then the tenant of the premises, was 
ordered to pay various rent arrears to the landlord. It was recorded in the order 
that the applicant did not appear on that date. 
b) On 25 September 2015, the Tribunal made orders for the applicant to pay 
damages to the landlord for the costs of lock replacement, storage costs and a 
removal truck. Deducted from the amount awarded to the landlord was the bond 
of $550. Also deducted was $130.00 for a rent overpayment. After those 
deductions, the amount payable by the applicant was only $113.49. It was 
recorded in the decision that the applicant did not appear on that date. 
c) The applicant then applied for a rehearing out of time, and that application 
came back before the Tribunal on 16 May 2016. It was recorded in the Tribunal’s 
decision of that date that an earlier application for a rehearing by the applicant 
had been dismissed at her request. After hearing from the parties, the Tribunal 
determined that the applicant had failed to establish the necessary grounds for a 
rehearing. 
d) On 25 May 2022, the applicant brought a fresh claim against the landlord with 
respect to these premises. Included in her application was a request for the bond 
to be refunded and allegations that she had been wrongfully evicted from the 
premises, as well as various allegations about unlawful increases in rent and the 
quality of the premises including mushrooms growing in the lounge and other 
alleged faults.  
e) The Tribunal set the matter down for a hearing on the question of jurisdiction 
given the Limitation Act 2010. The applicant did not appear at the hearing and 
her application was dismissed on 31 August 2022. 
f) An application was filed for a rehearing. According to the applicant today, she 
had appeared at the courthouse but may have been near the wrong courtroom at 
when the matter was called. 
g) On 15 September 2022, the application for a rehearing was dismissed. 
Recorded by the adjudicator in their decision was the following:
3. The tenant seeks to re-open matters dealt with by the Tribunal in 2015 when orders were 
made. 
4. The landlord attended the hearing on 31 August 2022 and submitted that the application was 
vexatious and outside the Limitation Act time frame.
h) On 6 October 2020 the Tribunal dismissed a second application for a 
rehearing. 
Analysis 5. Section 11 of the Limitation Act 2010 provides: 
Defence to money claim filed after applicable period
(1) It is a defence to a money claim if the defendant proves that the date on which the claim is 
filed is at least 6 years after the date of the act or omission on which the claim is based).
6. Section 92A of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that:
The Tribunal may strike out, in whole or in part, a proceeding if satisfied that it—
(a) discloses no reasonable cause of action; or
(b) is likely to cause prejudice or delay; or
(c) is frivolous or vexatious; or
(d) is otherwise an abuse of process.
7. The matters raised within this application appear to be well outside the six year 
time frame for the bringing of any claim for damages against another party. 
8. More significantly, the subject matter of this application is essentially the same as 
the application that was filed in 2022. Similar allegations are made in that the two 
claims essentially relate to the manner of termination of the tenancy, the alleged 
quality of the premises, and the question of bond. Where an application is made 
to the Tribunal which is dismissed and where two applications for rehearing and 
relation to that application are also unsuccessful, it is an abuse of  process and / 
or vexatious for the Tribunal to allow a fresh application to be made raising, 
essentially, all of those same issues. 
9. In her evidence today, the applicant said, several times, words to the effect, that 
the bond had not been refunded to her. I have set out a summary of the prior 
orders of the Tribunal to clarify for her benefit that whilst the bond may not have 
been paid to her, it has been taken into account in fixing amounts that she should 
pay to the landlord.

of $550. Also deducted was $130.00 for a rent overpayment. After those 
deductions, the amount payable by the applicant was only $113.49. It was 
recorded in the decision that the applicant did not appear on that date. 
c) The applicant then applied for a rehearing out of time, and that application 
came back before the Tribunal on 16 May 2016. It was recorded in the Tribunal’s 
decision of that date that an earlier application for a rehearing by the applicant 
had been dismissed at her request. After hearing from the parties, the Tribunal 
determined that the applicant had failed to establish the necessary grounds for a 
rehearing. 
d) On 25 May 2022, the applicant brought a fresh claim against the landlord with 
respect to these premises. Included in her application was a request for the bond 
to be refunded and allegations that she had been wrongfully evicted from the 
premises, as well as various allegations about unlawful increases in rent and the 
quality of the premises including mushrooms growing in the lounge and other 
alleged faults.  
e) The Tribunal set the matter down for a hearing on the question of jurisdiction 
given the Limitation Act 2010. The applicant did not appear at the hearing and 
her application was dismissed on 31 August 2022. 
f) An application was filed for a rehearing. According to the applicant today, she 
had appeared at the courthouse but may have been near the wrong courtroom at 
when the matter was called. 
g) On 15 September 2022, the application for a rehearing was dismissed. 
Recorded by the adjudicator in their decision was the following:
3. The tenant seeks to re-open matters dealt with by the Tribunal in 2015 when orders were 
made. 
4. The landlord attended the hearing on 31 August 2022 and submitted that the application was 
vexatious and outside the Limitation Act time frame.
h) On 6 October 2020 the Tribunal dismissed a second application for a 
rehearing. 
Analysis 5. Section 11 of the Limitation Act 2010 provides: 
Defence to money claim filed after applicable period
(1) It is a defence to a money claim if the defendant proves that the date on which the claim is 
filed is at least 6 years after the date of the act or omission on which the claim is based).
6. Section 92A of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that:
The Tribunal may strike out, in whole or in part, a proceeding if satisfied that it—
(a) discloses no reasonable cause of action; or
(b) is likely to cause prejudice or delay; or
(c) is frivolous or vexatious; or
(d) is otherwise an abuse of process.
7. The matters raised within this application appear to be well outside the six year 
time frame for the bringing of any claim for damages against another party. 
8. More significantly, the subject matter of this application is essentially the same as 
the application that was filed in 2022. Similar allegations are made in that the two 
claims essentially relate to the manner of termination of the tenancy, the alleged 
quality of the premises, and the question of bond. Where an application is made 
to the Tribunal which is dismissed and where two applications for rehearing and 
relation to that application are also unsuccessful, it is an abuse of  process and / 
or vexatious for the Tribunal to allow a fresh application to be made raising, 
essentially, all of those same issues. 
9. In her evidence today, the applicant said, several times, words to the effect, that 
the bond had not been refunded to her. I have set out a summary of the prior 
orders of the Tribunal to clarify for her benefit that whilst the bond may not have 
been paid to her, it has been taken into account in fixing amounts that she should 
pay to the landlord.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - 
APPLICANT: Anita Lois Dudley
 Tenant
RESPONDENT: [The respondent/s] 
 Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: [Tenancy address suppressed]
ORDER
1. An order for suppression is made of the Landlord’s name and identifying details.
2. The application is dismissed.
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.
2. This application was filed on 20 March 2023. It relates to a tenancy which 
terminated on 20 July 2015. The applicant claims compensation against the 
landlord for a range of factors, including for failure to return the bond, unfair 
increases in rent, wrongful termination of the tenancy and for the allegedly poor 
condition of the property, including an allegation of mushrooms growing on the 
carpet in the lounge. 
3. As was discussed with the parties at the outset of the hearing, the question of 
jurisdiction arises because of the length of time that has passed between the end 
of the tenancy and the date of the application being filed and also because of the 
fact that this matter has been dealt with previously by the Tribunal. 
Background facts 4. A brief summary of the earlier orders of the Tribunal is as follows: 
a) On 22 July 2015, an order was made granting possession of the premises to 
the landlord. The applicant, who was then the tenant of the premises, was 
ordered to pay various rent arrears to the landlord. It was recorded in the order 
that the applicant did not appear on that date. 
b) On 25 September 2015, the Tribunal made orders for the applicant to pay 
damages to the landlord for the costs of lock replacement, storage costs and a 
removal truck. Deducted from the amount awarded to the landlord was the bond 
of $550. Also deducted was $130.00 for a rent overpayment. After those 
deductions, the amount payable by the applicant was only $113.49. It was 
recorded in the decision that the applicant did not appear on that date. 
c) The applicant then applied for a rehearing out of time, and that application 
came back before the Tribunal on 16 May 2016. It was recorded in the Tribunal’s 
decision of that date that an earlier application for a rehearing by the applicant 
had been dismissed at her request. After hearing from the parties, the Tribunal 
determined that the applicant had failed to establish the necessary grounds for a 
rehearing. 
d) On 25 May 2022, the applicant brought a fresh claim against the landlord with 
respect to these premises. Included in her application was a request for the bond 
to be refunded and allegations that she had been wrongfully evicted from the 
premises, as well as various allegations about unlawful increases in rent and the 
quality of the premises including mushrooms growing in the lounge and other 
alleged faults.  
e) The Tribunal set the matter down for a hearing on the question of jurisdiction 
given the Limitation Act 2010. The applicant did not appear at the hearing and 
her application was dismissed on 31 August 2022. 
f) An application was filed for a rehearing. According to the applicant today, she 
had appeared at the courthouse but may have been near the wrong courtroom at 
when the matter was called. 
g) On 15 September 2022, the application for a rehearing was dismissed. 
Recorded by the adjudicator in their decision was the following:
3. The tenant seeks to re-open matters dealt with by the Tribunal in 2015 when orders were 
made. 
4. The landlord attended the hearing on 31 August 2022 and submitted that the application was 
vexatious and outside the Limitation Act time frame.
h) On 6 October 2020 the Tribunal dismissed a second application for a 
rehearing. 
Analysis 5. Section 11 of the Limitation Act 2010 provides: 
Defence to money claim filed after applicable period
(1) It is a defence to a money claim if the defendant proves that the date on which the claim is 
filed is at least 6 years after the date of the act or omission on which the claim is based).

The Tribunal may strike out, in whole or in part, a proceeding if satisfied that it—
(a) discloses no reasonable cause of action; or
(b) is likely to cause prejudice or delay; or
(c) is frivolous or vexatious; or
(d) is otherwise an abuse of process.
7. The matters raised within this application appear to be well outside the six year 
time frame for the bringing of any claim for damages against another party. 
8. More significantly, the subject matter of this application is essentially the same as 
the application that was filed in 2022. Similar allegations are made in that the two 
claims essentially relate to the manner of termination of the tenancy, the alleged 
quality of the premises, and the question of bond. Where an application is made 
to the Tribunal which is dismissed and where two applications for rehearing and 
relation to that application are also unsuccessful, it is an abuse of  process and / 
or vexatious for the Tribunal to allow a fresh application to be made raising, 
essentially, all of those same issues. 
9. In her evidence today, the applicant said, several times, words to the effect, that 
the bond had not been refunded to her. I have set out a summary of the prior 
orders of the Tribunal to clarify for her benefit that whilst the bond may not have 
been paid to her, it has been taken into account in fixing amounts that she should 
pay to the landlord.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - [Event location suppressed]
APPLICANT: [The applicant/s]
 Tenant
RESPONDENT: Nicholas (Nick) Kulavovsky, Natalya Kulakovska
 Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: 154 Barrack Road, Mount Wellington, Auckland 1060
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the Tenant’s name and identifying details.
2. Nicholas (Nick) Kulavovsky and Natalya Kulakovska must pay [The tenant/s] 
$500.00 immediately.
3. The tenant’s claims for breach of quiet enjoyment and providing a termination 
without lawful reason are dismissed as not proven 
4. The tenant’s claim for retaliatory notice is outside time and therefore is struck out.
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended today’s hearing.
2. The tenancy began in 2019 and ended on the 21 May 2023.
3. The tenant claims that the landlord:
a) Unlawfully entered the property on or about the 1 January 2023 (s48)
b) Breached her quiet enjoyment by coming to the property on multiple 
occasions without telling her and by his conduct on the 1 January. (s38)
c) Gave a notice to terminate the tenancy without valid reason on the 18 January 
2023. (s60AA)d) Gave a retaliatory notice to the tenant on the 18 January 2023. (s54).
4. The tenant claims exemplary damages for the alleged breaches.
Did the landlord unlawfully enter the premises?
5. A landlord may not enter the premises during the tenancy except with the tenant's 
consent, in an emergency, or after giving the required notice for inspections and 
repairs and maintenance.  See section 48(1) and (2) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.
6. A landlord does not need to give notice if they are only going to the property to 
do something outside of the premises. See s48(7)
7. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages may 
be awarded up to a maximum of $1,500.00.  See section 48 (4)(a) and Schedule 
1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
8. The landlord went to the property on about the 1 January 2023 (the landlord says 
that it is the 3 January- the text correspondence supports the tenant’s claim that 
it was the 1 January 2023) following a report from his selling agent that there was 
water ponding in the basement area. The basement area has a separate entrance 
and had been prone to flooding in the past. The landlord had recently renovated 
the basement and thought that he had remedied the flooding problem. He says 
that he was concerned as to why the basement was flooded again.
9. I am satisfied that the landlord did not give notice to the tenant as the tenant 
texted the landlord and said someone was at the property, to which the landlord 
confirmed it was him. The landlord did not obtain the tenant’s consent to go into 
the basement. I find he has committed an unlawful act.
10. Where a party has committed an unlawful act intentionally, the Tribunal may 
award exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having 
regard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other 
party, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
11. I am satisfied that the landlord acted with intention in that he intended to go into 
the basement. The landlord was aware that the tenant expected the landlord to 
give her notice as can be seen in the following text exchange on the 12 
November:
[The tenant/s]: Nick, please before you come send me a text about your arrival. It’s 
scary when someone walks under the house and around the property. Two people have 
robbed our cars under the carport, stolen the lawn mower and climbed into our basement 
on two occasions. The girls don’t like you walking around the property either. Thanks for 
understanding, [The tenant/s]. 
Nick: [The tenant/s], I’m so sorry it happened. I went right after work to check the 
basement after the rain. Next time I will definitely inform you, Nick.12. The tenant tells me that having the landlord at the premises was stressful and 
unsettling.
13. I accept that the landlord was apologetic about coming to the property without 
notice and was doing so as he thought it was an emergency, but he should have 
been careful to tell the tenant that he was coming to the property and the purpose 
of his visit before he did so.
14. It is in the public interest that when a landlord breaches this obligation that an 
award of exemplary damages is made and taking into account all of the factors 
outlined above, I consider a modest award of $500.00 to be the appropriate award 
of damages for this act.
Did the landlord breach the tenant’s quiet enjoyment?
15. A landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace, comfort or privacy of the 
tenant in their use of the premises.  See section 38(2) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
16. Breaching this obligation in circumstances that amount to harassment is an 
unlawful act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of 
$3,000.00.  See section 38(3) and Schedule 1A RTA.
17. Harassment means ""to trouble, worry or distress"" or ""to wear out, tire, or exhaust"" 
and ""indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person"".  
MacDonald v Dodds, CIV-2009-019-001524, DC Hamilton, 26 February 2010.
18. The tenant claims that the landlord’s frequent entry to the basement was a breach 
of quiet enjoyment. Whilst I agree that the landlord’s entering the premises in 
breach of s48 is also a breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment, the courts have 
made it clear that the same act cannot be sanctioned twice. In other words that I 
cannot award two lots of damages for the same event. Manage My Rental Limited 
v Baxter [2015] NZDC 12011
I do not think it right to further censure the landlord by way of exemplary 
damages for the fact that those failures also resulted in an unlawful act under 
a different provision.[27]
19.  Therefore, the tenant’s claim for breach of quiet enjoyment in respect of the 
unlawful entry on the 1 January is dismissed.
20. The tenants have claimed that there were many occasions that the landlord came 
to the property unannounced. The tenant has not given dates or specifics for 
those other occasions apart from the 12 November. As mentioned, there was a 
serious issue with ponding in the basement that the landlord was trying to 
remedy. He tells me that he enjoyed a good relationship with the tenants until he 
put the house on the market, and he would call around after rain to check if the 
basement had leaked. He said he usually texted or called the tenant beforehand. 
He thought that the tenant was happy with him doing this until he received the 
tenant’s text of 12 November.21. Having heard the evidence and submissions of both parties I am satisfied that the 
landlord did not go the property for any other purpose but to check for leaks, and 
that apart from the unlawful entry on the 1 January 2023, he did not enter the 
property without first giving notice after the tenant had sent her text of the 12 
November 2022.
22. The tenant also claims that the landlord breached the tenant’s quiet enjoyment 
on the 1 January by the manner in which the landlord spoke to the tenant and the 
text messages between the tenant and landlord. Having heard the evidence from 
both parties it appears that the tenant thought that the landlord was accusing her 
of flooding the basement. I disagree with that interpretation. The landlord tells me 
that he was voicing his frustration to the tenant that he did not know what had 
caused the leaks and that he thought he had resolved the water problem. 
23. I do not consider the tone of the written correspondence to be that of harassment 
and I do not think that it was the landlord’s intention that the texts or conversation 
on the 1 January be to trouble, worry and distress the tenant.
24. I am not satisfied that the interaction with [Redacted] was a breach of the tenant’s 
quiet enjoyment. The landlord had never met [Redacted] before and he was quite 
correct to say he wanted to speak to the tenant not to [Redacted], as he did not 
know if [Redacted] was talking to him on behalf of the tenant or not.
25. The tenant’s claims for breach of quiet enjoyment are dismissed. 
Was the notice given on the 18 January 2023 retaliatory?
26. On the 18 January 2023, the landlord gave the tenant a notice ending the tenancy 
on 18 April 2023.  The tenant claims the notice is retaliatory.
27. For a notice to be declared retaliatory, the tenant must prove that in terminating 
the tenancy, the landlord was motivated wholly or partly by the tenant exercising 
a right under the tenancy agreement or any Act, or by any complaint against the 
landlord.  See section 54(1) Residential Tenancies Act 1986. 
28. An application for retaliatory notice must be brought within 28 working days of 
receipt of the notice. The tenant filed her claim on 9 July 2023, well after the time 
for filing a claim for retaliatory notice had expired. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction 
to hear this claim as it has been brought outside of time.
Did the landlord give a termination notice on the 18 January 2023 knowing that they 
were not entitled to do so?
29. Under Section 60AA a landlord must not give a notice to terminate the tenancy 
or apply to the Tribunal for such an order, knowing they are not entitled to do so.
30. Breaching any of these obligations without a reasonable excuse is an unlawful 
act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of 
$6500.00. See section 60AA and Schedule 1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.31. On the 18 January 2023 the landlord gave the tenant a termination notice which 
stated the following reasons for termination:
a) The premises are to be put on the market for sale.
b) The landlord is intending to carry out extensive alterations, refurbishment, 
repairs or redevelopment of the premises and that it would not be reasonably 
practicable for the tenant to live there whilst the work is being done.
32. There is no dispute that the property was on the market for sale at this time.
33. The tenant says that the landlord stating that they intended to carry out extensive 
alterations was giving notice knowingly that they are not entitled to do so.
34. Having heard and considered the evidence submitted I am not satisfied that the 
landlord gave a notice on the 18 January knowing that they were not entitled to 
do so, for the following reasons:
a) The landlord was entitled to give notice to end the tenancy legitimately as the 
property was on the market for sale.
b) The landlord told me that he had been advised by the selling agent that he 
needed to give notice in order to make the sale more attractive to buyers.
c) The landlord says that he thought that he had to tick the ‘extensive 
renovations or redevelopment’ box as a purchaser may want to do 
renovations.
d) English is the landlord’s second language and I accept that he did not 
understand that he only needed to tick the sale box.
e) In any event the landlord appointed a letting agent, who on the 20 January 
2023 rescinded the notice making it of no effect.
35. As the tenant has been partially successful, I grant the tenant name suppression.
36. As the tenant has not been wholly or substantially successful, I do not award the 
filing fee.

the basement and thought that he had remedied the flooding problem. He says 
that he was concerned as to why the basement was flooded again.
9. I am satisfied that the landlord did not give notice to the tenant as the tenant 
texted the landlord and said someone was at the property, to which the landlord 
confirmed it was him. The landlord did not obtain the tenant’s consent to go into 
the basement. I find he has committed an unlawful act.
10. Where a party has committed an unlawful act intentionally, the Tribunal may 
award exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having 
regard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other 
party, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
11. I am satisfied that the landlord acted with intention in that he intended to go into 
the basement. The landlord was aware that the tenant expected the landlord to 
give her notice as can be seen in the following text exchange on the 12 
November:
[The tenant/s]: Nick, please before you come send me a text about your arrival. It’s 
scary when someone walks under the house and around the property. Two people have 
robbed our cars under the carport, stolen the lawn mower and climbed into our basement 
on two occasions. The girls don’t like you walking around the property either. Thanks for 
understanding, [The tenant/s]. 
Nick: [The tenant/s], I’m so sorry it happened. I went right after work to check the 
basement after the rain. Next time I will definitely inform you, Nick.12. The tenant tells me that having the landlord at the premises was stressful and 
unsettling.
13. I accept that the landlord was apologetic about coming to the property without 
notice and was doing so as he thought it was an emergency, but he should have 
been careful to tell the tenant that he was coming to the property and the purpose 
of his visit before he did so.
14. It is in the public interest that when a landlord breaches this obligation that an 
award of exemplary damages is made and taking into account all of the factors 
outlined above, I consider a modest award of $500.00 to be the appropriate award 
of damages for this act.
Did the landlord breach the tenant’s quiet enjoyment?
15. A landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace, comfort or privacy of the 
tenant in their use of the premises.  See section 38(2) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
16. Breaching this obligation in circumstances that amount to harassment is an 
unlawful act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of 
$3,000.00.  See section 38(3) and Schedule 1A RTA.
17. Harassment means ""to trouble, worry or distress"" or ""to wear out, tire, or exhaust"" 
and ""indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person"".  
MacDonald v Dodds, CIV-2009-019-001524, DC Hamilton, 26 February 2010.
18. The tenant claims that the landlord’s frequent entry to the basement was a breach 
of quiet enjoyment. Whilst I agree that the landlord’s entering the premises in 
breach of s48 is also a breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment, the courts have 
made it clear that the same act cannot be sanctioned twice. In other words that I 
cannot award two lots of damages for the same event. Manage My Rental Limited 
v Baxter [2015] NZDC 12011
I do not think it right to further censure the landlord by way of exemplary 
damages for the fact that those failures also resulted in an unlawful act under 
a different provision.[27]
19.  Therefore, the tenant’s claim for breach of quiet enjoyment in respect of the 
unlawful entry on the 1 January is dismissed.
20. The tenants have claimed that there were many occasions that the landlord came 
to the property unannounced. The tenant has not given dates or specifics for 
those other occasions apart from the 12 November. As mentioned, there was a 
serious issue with ponding in the basement that the landlord was trying to 
remedy. He tells me that he enjoyed a good relationship with the tenants until he 
put the house on the market, and he would call around after rain to check if the 
basement had leaked. He said he usually texted or called the tenant beforehand. 
He thought that the tenant was happy with him doing this until he received the 
tenant’s text of 12 November.21. Having heard the evidence and submissions of both parties I am satisfied that the 
landlord did not go the property for any other purpose but to check for leaks, and 
that apart from the unlawful entry on the 1 January 2023, he did not enter the 
property without first giving notice after the tenant had sent her text of the 12 
November 2022.
22. The tenant also claims that the landlord breached the tenant’s quiet enjoyment 
on the 1 January by the manner in which the landlord spoke to the tenant and the 
text messages between the tenant and landlord. Having heard the evidence from 
both parties it appears that the tenant thought that the landlord was accusing her 
of flooding the basement. I disagree with that interpretation. The landlord tells me 
that he was voicing his frustration to the tenant that he did not know what had 
caused the leaks and that he thought he had resolved the water problem. 
23. I do not consider the tone of the written correspondence to be that of harassment 
and I do not think that it was the landlord’s intention that the texts or conversation 
on the 1 January be to trouble, worry and distress the tenant.
24. I am not satisfied that the interaction with [Redacted] was a breach of the tenant’s 
quiet enjoyment. The landlord had never met [Redacted] before and he was quite 
correct to say he wanted to speak to the tenant not to [Redacted], as he did not 
know if [Redacted] was talking to him on behalf of the tenant or not.
25. The tenant’s claims for breach of quiet enjoyment are dismissed. 
Was the notice given on the 18 January 2023 retaliatory?
26. On the 18 January 2023, the landlord gave the tenant a notice ending the tenancy 
on 18 April 2023.  The tenant claims the notice is retaliatory.
27. For a notice to be declared retaliatory, the tenant must prove that in terminating 
the tenancy, the landlord was motivated wholly or partly by the tenant exercising 
a right under the tenancy agreement or any Act, or by any complaint against the 
landlord.  See section 54(1) Residential Tenancies Act 1986. 
28. An application for retaliatory notice must be brought within 28 working days of 
receipt of the notice. The tenant filed her claim on 9 July 2023, well after the time 
for filing a claim for retaliatory notice had expired. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction 
to hear this claim as it has been brought outside of time.
Did the landlord give a termination notice on the 18 January 2023 knowing that they 
were not entitled to do so?
29. Under Section 60AA a landlord must not give a notice to terminate the tenancy 
or apply to the Tribunal for such an order, knowing they are not entitled to do so.
30. Breaching any of these obligations without a reasonable excuse is an unlawful 
act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of 
$6500.00. See section 60AA and Schedule 1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.31. On the 18 January 2023 the landlord gave the tenant a termination notice which 
stated the following reasons for termination:
a) The premises are to be put on the market for sale.
b) The landlord is intending to carry out extensive alterations, refurbishment, 
repairs or redevelopment of the premises and that it would not be reasonably 
practicable for the tenant to live there whilst the work is being done.
32. There is no dispute that the property was on the market for sale at this time.
33. The tenant says that the landlord stating that they intended to carry out extensive 
alterations was giving notice knowingly that they are not entitled to do so.
34. Having heard and considered the evidence submitted I am not satisfied that the 
landlord gave a notice on the 18 January knowing that they were not entitled to 
do so, for the following reasons:
a) The landlord was entitled to give notice to end the tenancy legitimately as the 
property was on the market for sale.
b) The landlord told me that he had been advised by the selling agent that he 
needed to give notice in order to make the sale more attractive to buyers.
c) The landlord says that he thought that he had to tick the ‘extensive 
renovations or redevelopment’ box as a purchaser may want to do 
renovations.
d) English is the landlord’s second language and I accept that he did not 
understand that he only needed to tick the sale box.
e) In any event the landlord appointed a letting agent, who on the 20 January 
2023 rescinded the notice making it of no effect.
35. As the tenant has been partially successful, I grant the tenant name suppression.
36. As the tenant has not been wholly or substantially successful, I do not award the 
filing fee.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - [Event location suppressed]
APPLICANT: [The applicant/s]
 Tenant
RESPONDENT: Nicholas (Nick) Kulavovsky, Natalya Kulakovska
 Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: 154 Barrack Road, Mount Wellington, Auckland 1060
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the Tenant’s name and identifying details.
2. Nicholas (Nick) Kulavovsky and Natalya Kulakovska must pay [The tenant/s] 
$500.00 immediately.
3. The tenant’s claims for breach of quiet enjoyment and providing a termination 
without lawful reason are dismissed as not proven 
4. The tenant’s claim for retaliatory notice is outside time and therefore is struck out.
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended today’s hearing.
2. The tenancy began in 2019 and ended on the 21 May 2023.
3. The tenant claims that the landlord:
a) Unlawfully entered the property on or about the 1 January 2023 (s48)
b) Breached her quiet enjoyment by coming to the property on multiple 
occasions without telling her and by his conduct on the 1 January. (s38)
c) Gave a notice to terminate the tenancy without valid reason on the 18 January 
2023. (s60AA)d) Gave a retaliatory notice to the tenant on the 18 January 2023. (s54).
4. The tenant claims exemplary damages for the alleged breaches.
Did the landlord unlawfully enter the premises?
5. A landlord may not enter the premises during the tenancy except with the tenant's 
consent, in an emergency, or after giving the required notice for inspections and 
repairs and maintenance.  See section 48(1) and (2) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.
6. A landlord does not need to give notice if they are only going to the property to 
do something outside of the premises. See s48(7)
7. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages may 
be awarded up to a maximum of $1,500.00.  See section 48 (4)(a) and Schedule 
1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
8. The landlord went to the property on about the 1 January 2023 (the landlord says 
that it is the 3 January- the text correspondence supports the tenant’s claim that 
it was the 1 January 2023) following a report from his selling agent that there was 
water ponding in the basement area. The basement area has a separate entrance 
and had been prone to flooding in the past. The landlord had recently renovated 
the basement and thought that he had remedied the flooding problem. He says 
that he was concerned as to why the basement was flooded again.
9. I am satisfied that the landlord did not give notice to the tenant as the tenant 
texted the landlord and said someone was at the property, to which the landlord 
confirmed it was him. The landlord did not obtain the tenant’s consent to go into

award exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having 
regard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other 
party, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) Residential Tenancies Act

16. Breaching this obligation in circumstances that amount to harassment is an 
unlawful act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of 
$3,000.00.  See section 38(3) and Schedule 1A RTA.
17. Harassment means ""to trouble, worry or distress"" or ""to wear out, tire, or exhaust"" 
and ""indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person"".

26. On the 18 January 2023, the landlord gave the tenant a notice ending the tenancy 
on 18 April 2023.  The tenant claims the notice is retaliatory.
27. For a notice to be declared retaliatory, the tenant must prove that in terminating

29. Under Section 60AA a landlord must not give a notice to terminate the tenancy

1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the Landlord name and identifying details.
2. Sapphire Kaponga must pay [The landlord/s] $2,032.80 immediately, calculated 
as shown in table below.
Description Landlord Tenant
Rent arrears $310.00  
curtains $270.00  
heat pump remote $59.00  
Lock/key replacement $130.00  
Rubbish removal $83.86

Cleaning: oven $34.50  
Repairs: holes $368.00  
hang curtains $240.00  
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44  
Total award $2,032.80  
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $2,032.80  Reasons:
1. The landlord attended the hearing. The tenant did not appear.
2. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, compensation and reimbursement of 
the filing fee following the end of the tenancy. The bond was refunded by a 
previous order from the Tribunal for rent arrears.
3. The tenancy started on 31 December 2021 and ended on 1 June 2023. The 
tenant was given an extra week to attend to the cleaning, and the rent for this 
week is claimed.
4. The premises were a small 2 bedroomed unit.
5. The claim for compensation for lighting was withdrawn.
How much is owed for rent?
6. The tenant left the premises on 8 June 2023.  The landlord provided rent records 
and copies of emails where the tenant agreed to drop the keys off on 8 June 2023 
after spending an extra week there after the tenancy ended.
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
7. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all 
chattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential 
Tenancies Act 1986.  
8. The tenant did not leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not 
remove all rubbish in the recycling bins. There were also some larger items 
removed and destroyed.  This was a small premises and the amount claimed for 
half cleaning costs, oven clean and carpet clean is awarded. Photographs 
supplied support the claims.
9. The tenant did not return the keys. 
10. The following chattels were missing at the end of the tenancy: The heat pump 
remote, blinds in the kitchen and curtains in two bedrooms. 
11. The amounts ordered are proved.
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
12. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the damage. Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission. See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
13. Where the damage is careless, and occurs after 27 August 2019, section 49B 
RTA applies. If the landlord becomes aware of the damage after 27 August, the 
damage is presumed to have occurred after that date unless the tenant proves 
otherwise. 
14. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord's 
insurance, the tenant's liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or 
four weeks' rent (or four weeks' market rent in the case of a tenant paying income-
related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  
15. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, 
the tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent).  See section 
49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the tenant's 
conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the damage.  See 
section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.
16. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
17. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
18. The following damage was caused during the tenancy: 2 holes in a door and wall, 
and a damaged window stay.
19. The holes were in bedroom 1 and there had been an attempt to fix them. The 
tenant did not attend the hearing to explain the damages. I find this intentional 
damage. 
20. There were 2 window stays claimed but only evidence that one was there at the 
start of the tenancy. This one had been damaged and the window was unable to 
be used.
21. The damage is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved 
liability for the damage.
22. The amounts ordered are proved.
23. I have taken into account betterment and depreciation.  The landlord should be 
returned to the position they would have been in had the tenant not breached 
their obligations, and should not be better or worse off. In calculating depreciation, 
I have taken into account the age and condition of the items at the start of the 
tenancy and their likely useful lifespan.   
24. Because [The landlord/s] has substantially succeeded with the claim I have 
reimbursed the filing fee.

supplied support the claims.
9. The tenant did not return the keys. 
10. The following chattels were missing at the end of the tenancy: The heat pump 
remote, blinds in the kitchen and curtains in two bedrooms. 
11. The amounts ordered are proved.
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
12. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the damage. Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission. See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
13. Where the damage is careless, and occurs after 27 August 2019, section 49B 
RTA applies. If the landlord becomes aware of the damage after 27 August, the 
damage is presumed to have occurred after that date unless the tenant proves 
otherwise. 
14. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord's 
insurance, the tenant's liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or 
four weeks' rent (or four weeks' market rent in the case of a tenant paying income-
related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  
15. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, 
the tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent).  See section 
49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the tenant's 
conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the damage.  See 
section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.
16. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
17. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
18. The following damage was caused during the tenancy: 2 holes in a door and wall, 
and a damaged window stay.
19. The holes were in bedroom 1 and there had been an attempt to fix them. The 
tenant did not attend the hearing to explain the damages. I find this intentional 
damage. 
20. There were 2 window stays claimed but only evidence that one was there at the 
start of the tenancy. This one had been damaged and the window was unable to 
be used.
21. The damage is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved 
liability for the damage.
22. The amounts ordered are proved.
23. I have taken into account betterment and depreciation.  The landlord should be 
returned to the position they would have been in had the tenant not breached 
their obligations, and should not be better or worse off. In calculating depreciation, 
I have taken into account the age and condition of the items at the start of the 
tenancy and their likely useful lifespan.   
24. Because [The landlord/s] has substantially succeeded with the claim I have 
reimbursed the filing fee.

14. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, 
the tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent).  See section 
49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the 
tenant's conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the 
damage.  See section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.
15. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
16. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
17. A window was broken damage during the tenancy. The landlord said that the 
tenant admitted breaking the window whilst moving out and that the tenant had 
said to deduct the cost from his bond. The damage is more than fair wear and 
tear, and the tenant has not disproved liability for the damage. The repair 
invoice is for $324.59.
18. The amounts ordered are proved.
19. As [The landlord/s] has wholly succeeded with the claim I must order the tenant 
to reimburse the filing fee.
20. The landlord has applied for name suppression. The landlord has been wholly 
successful in this matter and suppression of the landlord details is ordered.

ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the Tenant and Landlords’ names and identifying details.
2. The applications are dismissed.
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.
2. Each of the parties have brought an application against the other.
3. The tenant’s application concerns his claim that he has been harassed by the 
landlords.
4. The landlords seek a series of work orders requiring the tenant to repair the 
damage that the tenant’s dog “F” has caused to both the inside and outside of 
the premises.
The tenant’s claim
5. Section 38(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that a landlord 
shall not cause or permit any interference with the reasonable peace, comfort, 
or privacy of the tenant in the use of the premises. Contravention of s38(2) in 
circumstances that amount to harassment is an unlawful act.
6. The tenant stated that the landlords had harassed him by:• inspecting the premises two days after he had broken his leg and then 
advising him of various ‘issues’ in relation to that inspection; and
•Threatening to terminate his tenancy because he had not repaired the 
damage to the premises as per a 14 day notice issued to him dated 4 May 
2023 and in an email dated 30 July 2023.
7. I am dismissing the tenant’s claim because neither of these two actions support 
his contention that he was being harassed. The tenant had allowed the 
inspection and the landlords were legally entitled to point out any issues in 
relation to that inspection.  Further, there is no evidence that when the tenant 
had not repaired the damage to the premises as required by the 14 day notice, 
there was a threat to terminate his tenancy.
The landlords’ claim
8. It was acknowledged by both parties at today’s hearing that the tenant was 
responsible for repairing any damage done by F or any other dog or person he 
had allowed onto the property.  The landlords sought work orders for the tenant 
to undertake these repairs.
9. I am dismissing the claim for work orders because the general understanding is 
that tenants are to return the premises to the landlord in a reasonable condition 
at the end of the tenancy.  There is no obligation to undertake repairs during the 
tenancy.
10. I also explained s40(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986.  That section 
provides that a tenant shall not intentionally or carelessly damage, or permit any 
other person to damage, the premises.
11. At today’s hearing the tenant understood the obligation to repair or pay the cost 
of repairing damages caused by F.  Allowing F to continue damaging the 
premises is seen as intentional damage for which the tenant is liable as 
provided by s40(2) – his obligation is to stop the damage from continuing.  
12. Although the tenant states that F has largely outgrown his destructive behaviour 
he acknowledges that F cannot resist chewing the irrigation system which 
makes it inoperable.  There was an understanding at today’s hearing that the 
tenant will have the irrigation system operational when his tenancy ends and 
that in the meantime he will undertake to replicate the function of the irrigation 
system by hosing the area that the irrigation system covers. 
Filing fee reimbursement
13. If a party is wholly or substantially successful in their claim, then the Tribunal 
orders the other party to reimburse them the filing fee.  Neither party were 
successful in their claims and so each party must bear their own cost of filing in 
the Tribunal.Suppression
14. Section 95A of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that:
(1) The Tribunal may, on the application of any party to the proceedings or on 
its own initiative, having regard to the interests of the parties and to the 
public interest order that all or part of the evidence given or the name or 
any identifying particulars of any witness or party not be published.
(2) An order may be subject to any conditions that the Tribunal considers 
appropriate.
(3) If a party that has wholly or substantially succeeded in the proceedings 
applies for an order that their name or identifying particulars not be 
published, the Tribunal must make the order unless the Tribunal considers 
that publication is in the public interest, or is justified because of the party’s 
conduct or any other circumstances of the case.
15. On my own initiative and after discussion with both parties today, I am ordering 
both parties’ names to be suppressed.  This is because at today’s hearing I saw 
both parties trying to resolve the issues between them, and although both 
claims failed the issues between them were genuine.  I do not consider that 
there is any public interest in having their names published.

any identifying particulars of any witness or party not be published.
(2) An order may be subject to any conditions that the Tribunal considers 
appropriate.
(3) If a party that has wholly or substantially succeeded in the proceedings 
applies for an order that their name or identifying particulars not be 
published, the Tribunal must make the order unless the Tribunal considers 
that publication is in the public interest, or is justified because of the party’s 
conduct or any other circumstances of the case.
15. On my own initiative and after discussion with both parties today, I am ordering 
both parties’ names to be suppressed.  This is because at today’s hearing I saw 
both parties trying to resolve the issues between them, and although both 
claims failed the issues between them were genuine.  I do not consider that 
there is any public interest in having their names published.

tenancy act standard the tenant s claim that the landlord ha breached the landlord s obligation under section bb of rta which requires compliance with the tenant s considers that the landlord ha failed to comply with the ventilation standard the draught stopping standard and the insulation standard ha confirmed that when there are multiple claim for a breach under a single section section here then order of exemplary damage can be made i will therefore address the question of exemplary damage for all claimed section breach below the ventilation standard set out minimum expectation around window and door and in particular the area of door and window that are openable the standard also requires that each kitchen and bathroom have extractor fan installed with a minimum defined extraction capacity the doe provide exemption in specific circumstance the landlord and owner agreed that the premise did not have an extractor fan installed in the kitchen or the bathroom saying that the premise wa rented on the condition that the tenant knew that it may not comply with the the landlord and owner confirmed that they relied on the tenant telling them what wa wrong and then they would fix it immediately they said money wa not the issue but getting service people to attend wa delayed due to increased demand the landlord took to install an extractor fan in the bathroom which wa completed just before the tenancy ended the kitchen range hood wa still in the garage i find that they have breached the ventilation standard draught stopping the tenant s claim that the landlord ha breached the landlord s obligation under section bb of in relation to the draught stopping standard the draught stopping standard requires that residential premise be free from unreasonable gap and

the owner organised to get them replaced they were repaired on tenancy ended on the landlord said that he did not know about the window before this and they were waiting for the tenant to let them know what needed repairing a tenant ha the obligation to inform the landlord of any damage or repair a soon a possible after a tenancy begin but a landlord is required to comply with the within of any tenancy that commenced after when i consider this with the statement that the landlord had not looked at the premise before renting it out i find that the landlord ha breached the obligation comply with the ventilation standard insulation the tenant s claim that the landlord ha breached the obligation under section of by failing to insulate the premise in accordance with regulation from all residential premise must be insulated to a minimum standard where the premise were insulated before the ceiling insulation must have an r value of or for house of a brick or concrete block construction the underfloor insulation must have an r value of the insulation must be in reasonable condition where insulation is installed after the minimum r value for ceiling insulation is in zone and and for zone zone cover the island and central the minimum r value for underfloor insulation is there are exception to these requirement for example where it is not reasonably practicable or where there is a habitable space above or below the ceiling or floor that would otherwise have to be insulated the party agreed that the premise were not insulated i find they have committed an unlawful act by breaching the ventilation standard the draught standard and the insulation standard where a party ha committed an unlawful act intentionally the may award exemplary damage where it is satisfied it would be just to do so having regard to the party s intent the effect of the unlawful act the interest of the other party and the public interest see section rta breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damage may be awarded up to a maximum of see section a and a rta over and above the requirement to comply with landlord are to provide and maintain premise in a reasonable state of repair see section b in considering the requirement of section rta i conclude that by not looking at the premise before renting them out and stating that they probably do not comply that the landlord and owner have ignored their responsibility ignorance is no excuse for noncompliance it is not the role of the tenant to alert the landlord to their noncompliance with the requirement of the or there is a positive obligation on the landlord to comply i find that these breach are intentional this is strengthened by the reliance on the tenant to tell the landlord and owner what wa wrong with the this hand off approach doe not absolve the party from their responsibility the effect of the unlawful act for the tenant wa a draughty and possibly a premise unable to be secured without extractor fan mould is far more likely to occur and home with window that do not seal are very hard to heat the legal requirement to provide a warm insulated healthy home for tenant is what the have been introduced for and this is in the public interest i consider it just to make an order the maximum award for breaching this section is and there have been breach of this section i find it just to award an order of of the maximum being an order of wa there a breach of the tenant s quiet a landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace comfort or privacy of the tenant in their use of the see section residential tenancy act breaching this obligation in circumstance that amount to harassment is an unlawful act for which exemplary damage may be awarded up to a maximum of see section and a rta harassment mean to trouble worry or distress or to wear out tire or exhaust and indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person v dodds civ the tenant provided a text from landlord s partner saying that she had to leave because she had people at her property that the landlord did not like this wa later changed the landlord also sent the tenant a text saying that the owner could do what the fuck he want mhe is the owner so do what you have to the text were inappropriate and incorrect but i do not find that these text amount to a breach of the tenant s quiet enjoyment amounting to harassment this claim is dismissed the tenant s claim the landlord ha not lodged the bond with the within the required time a landlord must send any bond payment to the within working day after the payment is received see section residential tenancy act breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which the may award exemplary damage up to a maximum of see section and a residential tenancy act the landlord agrees that he wa paid the bond by and tried to lodge it but because he had paid the owner his bond he wa told that he could not lodge a bond for this tenancy the bond centre confirms that there is no bond lodged with this address and the owner confirmed that he had not lodged the first bond the landlord could have lodged the bond and failed to when asked where the money wa he said it wa long gone and put toward the tenant cost and rent arrears he believed that the tenant owed he did not have the fund now to cover the bond i find they have committed an unlawful act where a party ha committed an unlawful act intentionally the may award exemplary damage where it is satisfied it would be just to do so having regard to the party s intent the effect of the unlawful act the interest of the other party and the public interest see section residential tenancy act in consideration of the section rta i find that this wa an intentional breach a bond is not the landlord money but the tenant to be held in trust by the bond centre for end of tenancy claim the landlord ha used the tenant s money and confirmed that none of it is left the landlord said that he wa a first time landlord and did not know the requirement of the rta this is no excuse it is the responsibility of a landlord to know and comply with the requirement of the rta the consequence for the tenant is that she could not access the bond money for which she could be held liable to repay to it is in the public interest that tenant bond money is held by an independent bond centre a security for all party i find it just to make an award of bond refund the tenant ha applied for refund of the bond the landlord ha a claim against the bond but ha not filed a counterclaim with section b residential tenancy act provides that where a tenant applies for refund of the bond and the landlord seek payment from the bond the landlord must file an application

Owner
TENANCY ADDRESS: 9 Maungakawa Road, Cambridge, Cambridge 3496
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the Tenant name and identifying details.
2. Daniel Hannibal and Warwick John Kiely must pay [The tenant/s] $4,820.44 
immediately, calculated as shown in table below:
Description Landlord Tenant
Rent arrears $50.00  
Filing fee reimbursement  $20.44
Exemplary damages: Failure  to lodge bond  $250.00
Refund bond  $2,800.00
Exemplary damages: HHS breach  $1,800.00
Total award $50.00 $4,870.44
Net award  $4,820.44
Total payable by Landlord to Tenant  $4,820.44Reasons:
1. All the parties attended the hearing. The tenant appeared with a support person.
2. The owner, Mr Kiely, purchased the property in August 2022 and agreed to rent 
it to Mr Hannibal and his partner
3. For the clarity I will refer to  Mr Kiely as the owner, Mr Hannibal as the landlord 
and  [The tenant/s], as the tenant.
4. The owner was not sure at the time of purchase if the premises complied with the 
Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) 2019 (HHS) due to its age, 
being 50 years old, and because he had not inspected it before renting it out. 
5. The premises are a 4-bedroom house with 10 acres of land and shedding. The 
landlord then signed a tenancy agreement with the tenant renting out the house. 
The owner consented to this. The landlord continued to rent the balance of the  
land and sheds for his stock off the owner. 
6. The tenancy agreement listed Mr Hannibal as the ‘landlord’ and [The tenant/s] as 
the ‘tenant’. The start date of this tenancy was 5 November 2022. The tenant 
received support for the tenancy through WINZ and the landlord became a 
registered supplier to them receiving the bond and two weeks rent in advance.
7. Mr Hannibal said that he was told that he could not lodge the bond because there 
was already a bond paid for the premises, so he held on to the money.
8. During the tenancy the landlord used the bond money to cover costs and rent he 
found owing.
9. The tenant sought compensation, exemplary damages, refund of the bond 
following the end of the tenancy and reimbursement of the filling fee.
Is this tenancy assigned or was it sublet to the tenant?
10. The respondent landlord is the tenant of the property pursuant to a tenancy 
agreement with the owner. The issue is whether the tenancy was assigned or 
whether the landlord is a sub-landlord and the tenant a sub-tenant.
11. The Residential Tenancies Act 1983, RTA, defines assignment as a transfer to a 
person of all the rights that a tenant has under a tenancy agreement. See section 
2, RTA.
12. A tenant may assign a tenancy with the consent of the landlord. The effect of this 
is that from the date of the assignment, that is that the date a new tenancy begins, 
the outgoing tenant ceases to be responsible to the landlord for obligations 
imposed by the agreement and RTA. See section 43B,43C RTA13. A sub-tenancy however is a tenancy agreement between a tenant (sub-landlord) 
and another person (sub-tenant) where the tenant remains liable under a tenancy 
agreement to the landlord. 
14. A sub-tenant is the grantee of a tenancy with the right to occupy the premises 
exclusively or otherwise for rent, reflecting the definitions of ‘tenant and ‘tenancy’ 
in section2(1) of the RTA.
15. In the current circumstances a tenancy agreement was signed by the parties. The 
start date of this tenancy was 5 November 2022. The landlord received tenancy 
entry costs from WINZ on 14 November 2022, communicated with the tenant, 
managed the tenancy and referred repairs and concerns to the owner. 
16. The landlord argued that this was a casual arrangement that he organised to help 
the tenant out. I disagree. He was fully involved with the tenancy from signing an 
agreement as the landlord, receiving rent and bond, being called on with the 
owner for repairs and lawn mowing. The tenant had exclusive rights to occupy 
the premises.
17.  I find that this was a landlord tenant relationship, and that the premises were  
sublet to the tenant by the landlord. I dismiss the argument that this was a casual 
agreement between the parties. The tenancy is valid, and the RTA applies to all 
tenancies between a landlord and tenant. 
18. Both the owner and landlord were involved with the management of the tenancy 
and I find it appropriate to join the owner as a party to the proceedings.
19. For the clarity in this I will refer to  Mr Hannibal, as the landlord and  [The tenant/s], 
as the tenant.
How much is owing in rent?
20. The tenant disputed the amount claimed for rent arrears at the end of the tenancy. 
21. The rent record provided by the landlords stated $1100.00 owing at the end of 
the tenancy. The tenant agreed that she had not paid rent for the last two weeks 
rent for her tenancy.
22. On 14 November WINZ paid the landlord 3 payments of $2000.00, $800.00, and 
$400.00. On 8 November a further $1000.00 was paid. This was amounted to 
$2800.00 for the bond and $1400.00 for 2 weeks rent in advance.
23. A ‘bond record’ was supplied by the landlord and recorded a starting amount of 
$2800.00. The record showed where the landlord deducted rent owing from this 
amount.
24. The rent record did not record the $1400.00 payment from WINZ as 2 weeks rent 
in advance. 25. When this was taken into consideration the rent became $300.00 in credit. The 
parties agreed that the tenant owed half rent for the first week she was at the 
tenancy being $350.00. 
26. I find that the tenant owes $50.00 in rent arrears at the end of the tenancy.
How much is owed for water?
27. There was no individual water metre installed at the premises and  no way to 
determine the water use exclusively attributable to this tenancy. See section 39 
RTA.  The claim for compensation for water use Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
Heathy Homes standards.
28. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the landlord’s obligations 
under section 45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA), which 
requires compliance with the Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) 
2019 (HHS). [The tenant/s] considers that the landlord has failed to comply with 
the HHS ventilation standard, the HHS draught stopping standard and the HHS 
insulation standard.
29. The District Court has confirmed that when there are multiple claims for a breach 
under a single section (section 45 here), then only one order of exemplary 
damages can be made. I will therefore address the question of exemplary 
damages for all claimed section 45 breaches below.
Ventilation
30. The ventilation standard sets out minimum expectations around windows and 
doors, and in particular the area of doors and windows that are openable.  The 
standard also requires that each kitchen and bathroom have extractor fans 
installed with a minimum defined extraction capacity.  
31. The HHS does provide exemptions in specific circumstances.
32. The landlord and owner agreed that the premises did not have an extractor fan 
installed in the kitchen or the bathroom saying that the premises was rented on 
the condition that the tenant knew that it may not comply with the HHS.
33.  The landlord and owner confirmed that they relied on the tenant telling them what 
was wrong and then they would fix it immediately. They said money was not the 
issue but getting service people to attend was delayed due to increased 
demands.
34. The landlord took 5 months to install an extractor fan in the bathroom which was 
completed just before the tenancy ended. The kitchen range hood was still in the 
garage. I find that they have breached the ventilation standards.Draught stopping 
35. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the landlord’s obligations 
under section 45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 in relation to the 
HHS draught stopping standard.
36. The draught stopping standard requires that residential premises be free from 
unreasonable gaps and holes that are not an intentional part of the building, which 
allow draughts to arise.  
37. The windows in the main bedroom did not shut properly, some of the hinges were 
bent and there were gaps to the outside. The tenant said that it was a sunny warm 
house, but she needed to be able to open and shut the windows. She said that 
at the start of the tenancy she told the landlords partner about them,  but nothing 
was done. Photographs were provided in support.
38. The owner found a Facebook post later in the tenancy where the tenant raised 
concern about the standard of the premises and noted the problem with the 
windows. The owner organised to get them replaced. They were repaired on 2 
March 2023.The tenancy ended on 7 March 2023.
39. The landlord said that he did not know about the windows before this and they 
were waiting for the tenant to let them know what needed repairing. A tenant has 
the obligation to inform the landlord of any damages or repairs as soon as 
possible after a tenancy begins, but a landlord is required to comply with the HHS 
within 120 days of any tenancy that commenced after 28 August 2022.
40. When I consider this with the statement that the landlord had not looked at the 
premises before renting it out, I find that the landlord has breached the obligation 
comply with the HHS ventilation standard. 
Insulation
41. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the obligations under section 
45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 by failing to insulate the 
premises in accordance with the Residential Tenancies (Smoke Alarms and 
Insulation) Regulations 2016.
42. From 1 July 2019, all residential premises must be insulated to a minimum 
standard.  Where the premises were insulated before 1 July 2016, the ceiling 
insulation must have an R-value of at least 1.9 (or 1.5 for houses of a brick or 
concrete block construction).  The underfloor insulation must have an R-value of 
at least 0.9.  The insulation must be in reasonable condition.
43. Where insulation is installed after 1 July 2016, the minimum R-value for ceiling 
insulation is 2.9 in Zones 1 and 2, and 3.3 for Zone 3 (Zone 3 covers the South 
Island and central North Island).  The minimum R-value for underfloor insulation 
is 1.3.44. There are exceptions to these requirements, for example, where it is not 
reasonably practicable, or where there is a habitable space above or below the 
ceiling or floor that would otherwise have to be insulated.
45. The parties agreed that the premises were not insulated.
46. I find they have committed an unlawful act by breaching the ventilation standard 
the draught standard and the insulation standard.
47. Where a party has committed an unlawful act intentionally, the Tribunal may 
award exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having 
regard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other 
party, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) RTA. 
48. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages may 
be awarded up to a maximum of $7,200.00.  See section 45 (1)(A) and Schedule 
1A RTA.
49. Over and above the requirement to comply with the Healthy Homes Standards, 
landlords are to provide and maintain premises in a reasonable state of repair. 
See Section 45 (1)(b). 
50. In considering the requirements of section 109(3)RTA  I conclude that by not 
looking at the premises before renting them out, and stating that they probably 
do not comply, that the landlord and owner have ignored their responsibilities. 
Ignorance is no excuse for noncompliance.
51. It is not the role of the tenant to alert the landlord to their noncompliance with the 
requirements of the RTA or HHS. There is a positive obligation on the landlord to 
comply.
52.  I find that these breaches are intentional. This is strengthened by the reliance on 
the tenant to tell the landlord and owner what was wrong with the premises. This 
hands-off approach does not absolve the parties from their responsibilities.
53. The effect of the unlawful acts for the tenant was a draughty and possibly a 
premises unable to be secured. Without extractor fans mould is far more likely to 
occur and homes with windows that do not seal are very hard to heat. The legal 
requirement to provide a warm insulated healthy home for tenants is what the 
HHS have been introduced for and this is in the public interest.  
54. I consider it just to make an order.
55. The maximum award for breaching this section 45 (1A) is $7,200.00 and there 
have been three breaches of this section. I find it just to award an order of 25% 
of the maximum, being an order of $1800.00.
Was there a breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment.?57. A landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace, comfort or privacy of the 
tenant in their use of the premises.  See section 38(2) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
58. Breaching this obligation in circumstances that amount to harassment is an 
unlawful act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of 
$3,000.00.  See section 38(3) and Schedule 1A RTA.
59. Harassment means ""to trouble, worry or distress"" or ""to wear out, tire, or exhaust"" 
and ""indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person"".  
MacDonald v Dodds, CIV-2009-019-001524, DC Hamilton, 26 February 2010.
60. The tenant provided a text from landlord’s partner saying that she had to leave 
because she had people at her property that the landlord did not like. This was 
later changed.
61. The landlord also sent the tenant a text saying that the ‘owner could do what the 
fuck he wants m8,he is the owner, so do what you have to.’ 
62. The texts were inappropriate and incorrect, but I do not find that these texts 
amount to a breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment amounting to harassment.
63. This claim is dismissed.
Bond
64. [The tenant/s] claims the landlord has not lodged the bond with the Bond Centre 
within the required time.
65. A landlord must send any bond payment to the Bond Centre within 23 working 
days after the payment is received.  See section 19(1) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
66. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which the Tribunal may award 
exemplary damages up to a maximum of $1,500.00.  See section 19(2) and 
Schedule 1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
67. The landlord agrees that he was paid the bond by WINZ and tried to lodge it but 
because he had paid the owner his bond, he was told that he could not lodge a 
bond for this tenancy.
68. The bond centre confirms that there is no bond lodged with this address and the 
owner confirmed that he had not lodged the first bond.
69. The landlord could have lodged the bond and failed to. When asked where the 
money was, he said it was long gone and put toward the tenants costs and rent 
arrears he believed that the tenant owed. He did not have the funds now to cover 
the bond.
70.  I find they have committed an unlawful act.71. Where a party has committed an unlawful act intentionally, the Tribunal may 
award exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having 
regard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other 
party, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.
72. In consideration of the section 109(3) RTA,I find that this was an intentional 
breach. A bond is not the landlords money but the tenants to be held in trust by 
the bond centre for end of tenancy claims. The landlord has used the tenant’s 
money and confirmed that none of it is left.
73. The landlord said that he was a first-time landlord and did not know the 
requirements of the RTA. This is no excuse; it is the responsibility of a landlord 
to know and comply with the requirements of the RTA.
74. The consequence for the tenant is that she could not access the bond money for 
which she could be held liable to repay to WINZ.
75. It is in the public interest that tenants bond money is held by an independent bond 
centre as security for all parties.
76. I find it just to make an award of $250.00.
Bond refund
77. The tenant has applied for refund of the bond.  The landlord has a claim against 
the bond, but has not filed a counterclaim with Tenancy Services.  
78. Section 22B(2) Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that, where a tenant 
applies for refund of the bond, and the landlord seeks payment from the bond, 
the landlord must file an application setting out the details of the counterclaim. 
79.  Because the landlord has not filed a counterclaim the bond is refunded in full to 
the tenant.
Fencing
80. The tenant claimed that the premises were not fully fenced for children and that 
this was agreed upon. The premises were located down a long driveway and 
were situated on a working farm. There was an incident where a child was found 
down the road.
81. There was no evidence that the parties agreed this was a term of the tenancy.
82. This claim is dismissed.
Gardens
83. The tenant said that she was told her rent included the lawns being mown and 
the gardens being done. This never happened. The landlord said that this was not agreed to but the owner and himself mowed the lawns on occasions and when 
asked.
84. There was no evidence provided that the rent included lawn and garden 
maintenance. This claim is dismissed. 
85. Because [The tenant/s] has substantially succeeded with the claim I have 
reimbursed the filing fee.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - [Event location suppressed]
APPLICANT: [The applicant/s]
 Tenant
RESPONDENT: Daniel Hannibal
 Landlord
Warwick John Kiely
Owner
TENANCY ADDRESS: 9 Maungakawa Road, Cambridge, Cambridge 3496
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the Tenant name and identifying details.
2. Daniel Hannibal and Warwick John Kiely must pay [The tenant/s] $4,820.44 
immediately, calculated as shown in table below:
Description Landlord Tenant
Rent arrears $50.00  
Filing fee reimbursement  $20.44
Exemplary damages: Failure  to lodge bond  $250.00
Refund bond  $2,800.00
Exemplary damages: HHS breach  $1,800.00
Total award $50.00 $4,870.44
Net award  $4,820.44
Total payable by Landlord to Tenant  $4,820.44Reasons:
1. All the parties attended the hearing. The tenant appeared with a support person.
2. The owner, Mr Kiely, purchased the property in August 2022 and agreed to rent 
it to Mr Hannibal and his partner
3. For the clarity I will refer to  Mr Kiely as the owner, Mr Hannibal as the landlord 
and  [The tenant/s], as the tenant.
4. The owner was not sure at the time of purchase if the premises complied with the 
Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) 2019 (HHS) due to its age, 
being 50 years old, and because he had not inspected it before renting it out. 
5. The premises are a 4-bedroom house with 10 acres of land and shedding. The 
landlord then signed a tenancy agreement with the tenant renting out the house. 
The owner consented to this. The landlord continued to rent the balance of the  
land and sheds for his stock off the owner. 
6. The tenancy agreement listed Mr Hannibal as the ‘landlord’ and [The tenant/s] as 
the ‘tenant’. The start date of this tenancy was 5 November 2022. The tenant 
received support for the tenancy through WINZ and the landlord became a 
registered supplier to them receiving the bond and two weeks rent in advance.
7. Mr Hannibal said that he was told that he could not lodge the bond because there 
was already a bond paid for the premises, so he held on to the money.
8. During the tenancy the landlord used the bond money to cover costs and rent he 
found owing.
9. The tenant sought compensation, exemplary damages, refund of the bond 
following the end of the tenancy and reimbursement of the filling fee.
Is this tenancy assigned or was it sublet to the tenant?
10. The respondent landlord is the tenant of the property pursuant to a tenancy 
agreement with the owner. The issue is whether the tenancy was assigned or 
whether the landlord is a sub-landlord and the tenant a sub-tenant.
11. The Residential Tenancies Act 1983, RTA, defines assignment as a transfer to a 
person of all the rights that a tenant has under a tenancy agreement. See section 
2, RTA.
12. A tenant may assign a tenancy with the consent of the landlord. The effect of this 
is that from the date of the assignment, that is that the date a new tenancy begins, 
the outgoing tenant ceases to be responsible to the landlord for obligations 
imposed by the agreement and RTA. See section 43B,43C RTA13. A sub-tenancy however is a tenancy agreement between a tenant (sub-landlord) 
and another person (sub-tenant) where the tenant remains liable under a tenancy 
agreement to the landlord. 
14. A sub-tenant is the grantee of a tenancy with the right to occupy the premises 
exclusively or otherwise for rent, reflecting the definitions of ‘tenant and ‘tenancy’ 
in section2(1) of the RTA.
15. In the current circumstances a tenancy agreement was signed by the parties. The 
start date of this tenancy was 5 November 2022. The landlord received tenancy 
entry costs from WINZ on 14 November 2022, communicated with the tenant, 
managed the tenancy and referred repairs and concerns to the owner. 
16. The landlord argued that this was a casual arrangement that he organised to help 
the tenant out. I disagree. He was fully involved with the tenancy from signing an 
agreement as the landlord, receiving rent and bond, being called on with the 
owner for repairs and lawn mowing. The tenant had exclusive rights to occupy 
the premises.
17.  I find that this was a landlord tenant relationship, and that the premises were  
sublet to the tenant by the landlord. I dismiss the argument that this was a casual 
agreement between the parties. The tenancy is valid, and the RTA applies to all 
tenancies between a landlord and tenant. 
18. Both the owner and landlord were involved with the management of the tenancy 
and I find it appropriate to join the owner as a party to the proceedings.
19. For the clarity in this I will refer to  Mr Hannibal, as the landlord and  [The tenant/s], 
as the tenant.
How much is owing in rent?
20. The tenant disputed the amount claimed for rent arrears at the end of the tenancy. 
21. The rent record provided by the landlords stated $1100.00 owing at the end of 
the tenancy. The tenant agreed that she had not paid rent for the last two weeks 
rent for her tenancy.
22. On 14 November WINZ paid the landlord 3 payments of $2000.00, $800.00, and 
$400.00. On 8 November a further $1000.00 was paid. This was amounted to 
$2800.00 for the bond and $1400.00 for 2 weeks rent in advance.
23. A ‘bond record’ was supplied by the landlord and recorded a starting amount of 
$2800.00. The record showed where the landlord deducted rent owing from this 
amount.
24. The rent record did not record the $1400.00 payment from WINZ as 2 weeks rent 
in advance. 25. When this was taken into consideration the rent became $300.00 in credit. The 
parties agreed that the tenant owed half rent for the first week she was at the 
tenancy being $350.00. 
26. I find that the tenant owes $50.00 in rent arrears at the end of the tenancy.
How much is owed for water?
27. There was no individual water metre installed at the premises and  no way to 
determine the water use exclusively attributable to this tenancy. See section 39 
RTA.  The claim for compensation for water use Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
Heathy Homes standards.
28. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the landlord’s obligations 
under section 45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA), which 
requires compliance with the Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) 
2019 (HHS). [The tenant/s] considers that the landlord has failed to comply with 
the HHS ventilation standard, the HHS draught stopping standard and the HHS 
insulation standard.
29. The District Court has confirmed that when there are multiple claims for a breach 
under a single section (section 45 here), then only one order of exemplary 
damages can be made. I will therefore address the question of exemplary 
damages for all claimed section 45 breaches below.
Ventilation
30. The ventilation standard sets out minimum expectations around windows and 
doors, and in particular the area of doors and windows that are openable.  The 
standard also requires that each kitchen and bathroom have extractor fans 
installed with a minimum defined extraction capacity.  
31. The HHS does provide exemptions in specific circumstances.
32. The landlord and owner agreed that the premises did not have an extractor fan 
installed in the kitchen or the bathroom saying that the premises was rented on 
the condition that the tenant knew that it may not comply with the HHS.
33.  The landlord and owner confirmed that they relied on the tenant telling them what 
was wrong and then they would fix it immediately. They said money was not the 
issue but getting service people to attend was delayed due to increased 
demands.
34. The landlord took 5 months to install an extractor fan in the bathroom which was 
completed just before the tenancy ended. The kitchen range hood was still in the 
garage. I find that they have breached the ventilation standards.Draught stopping 
35. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the landlord’s obligations 
under section 45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 in relation to the 
HHS draught stopping standard.
36. The draught stopping standard requires that residential premises be free from 
unreasonable gaps and holes that are not an intentional part of the building, which 
allow draughts to arise.  
37. The windows in the main bedroom did not shut properly, some of the hinges were 
bent and there were gaps to the outside. The tenant said that it was a sunny warm 
house, but she needed to be able to open and shut the windows. She said that 
at the start of the tenancy she told the landlords partner about them,  but nothing 
was done. Photographs were provided in support.
38. The owner found a Facebook post later in the tenancy where the tenant raised 
concern about the standard of the premises and noted the problem with the 
windows. The owner organised to get them replaced. They were repaired on 2 
March 2023.The tenancy ended on 7 March 2023.
39. The landlord said that he did not know about the windows before this and they 
were waiting for the tenant to let them know what needed repairing. A tenant has 
the obligation to inform the landlord of any damages or repairs as soon as 
possible after a tenancy begins, but a landlord is required to comply with the HHS 
within 120 days of any tenancy that commenced after 28 August 2022.
40. When I consider this with the statement that the landlord had not looked at the 
premises before renting it out, I find that the landlord has breached the obligation 
comply with the HHS ventilation standard. 
Insulation
41. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the obligations under section 
45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 by failing to insulate the 
premises in accordance with the Residential Tenancies (Smoke Alarms and 
Insulation) Regulations 2016.
42. From 1 July 2019, all residential premises must be insulated to a minimum 
standard.  Where the premises were insulated before 1 July 2016, the ceiling 
insulation must have an R-value of at least 1.9 (or 1.5 for houses of a brick or 
concrete block construction).  The underfloor insulation must have an R-value of 
at least 0.9.  The insulation must be in reasonable condition.
43. Where insulation is installed after 1 July 2016, the minimum R-value for ceiling 
insulation is 2.9 in Zones 1 and 2, and 3.3 for Zone 3 (Zone 3 covers the South 
Island and central North Island).  The minimum R-value for underfloor insulation 
is 1.3.44. There are exceptions to these requirements, for example, where it is not 
reasonably practicable, or where there is a habitable space above or below the 
ceiling or floor that would otherwise have to be insulated.
45. The parties agreed that the premises were not insulated.
46. I find they have committed an unlawful act by breaching the ventilation standard 
the draught standard and the insulation standard.
47. Where a party has committed an unlawful act intentionally, the Tribunal may 
award exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having 
regard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other 
party, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) RTA. 
48. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages may 
be awarded up to a maximum of $7,200.00.  See section 45 (1)(A) and Schedule 
1A RTA.
49. Over and above the requirement to comply with the Healthy Homes Standards, 
landlords are to provide and maintain premises in a reasonable state of repair. 
See Section 45 (1)(b). 
50. In considering the requirements of section 109(3)RTA  I conclude that by not 
looking at the premises before renting them out, and stating that they probably 
do not comply, that the landlord and owner have ignored their responsibilities. 
Ignorance is no excuse for noncompliance.
51. It is not the role of the tenant to alert the landlord to their noncompliance with the 
requirements of the RTA or HHS. There is a positive obligation on the landlord to 
comply.
52.  I find that these breaches are intentional. This is strengthened by the reliance on 
the tenant to tell the landlord and owner what was wrong with the premises. This 
hands-off approach does not absolve the parties from their responsibilities.
53. The effect of the unlawful acts for the tenant was a draughty and possibly a 
premises unable to be secured. Without extractor fans mould is far more likely to 
occur and homes with windows that do not seal are very hard to heat. The legal 
requirement to provide a warm insulated healthy home for tenants is what the 
HHS have been introduced for and this is in the public interest.  
54. I consider it just to make an order.
55. The maximum award for breaching this section 45 (1A) is $7,200.00 and there 
have been three breaches of this section. I find it just to award an order of 25% 
of the maximum, being an order of $1800.00.
Was there a breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment.?57. A landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace, comfort or privacy of the 
tenant in their use of the premises.  See section 38(2) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
58. Breaching this obligation in circumstances that amount to harassment is an 
unlawful act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of 
$3,000.00.  See section 38(3) and Schedule 1A RTA.
59. Harassment means ""to trouble, worry or distress"" or ""to wear out, tire, or exhaust"" 
and ""indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person"".  
MacDonald v Dodds, CIV-2009-019-001524, DC Hamilton, 26 February 2010.
60. The tenant provided a text from landlord’s partner saying that she had to leave 
because she had people at her property that the landlord did not like. This was 
later changed.
61. The landlord also sent the tenant a text saying that the ‘owner could do what the 
fuck he wants m8,he is the owner, so do what you have to.’ 
62. The texts were inappropriate and incorrect, but I do not find that these texts 
amount to a breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment amounting to harassment.
63. This claim is dismissed.
Bond
64. [The tenant/s] claims the landlord has not lodged the bond with the Bond Centre 
within the required time.
65. A landlord must send any bond payment to the Bond Centre within 23 working 
days after the payment is received.  See section 19(1) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
66. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which the Tribunal may award 
exemplary damages up to a maximum of $1,500.00.  See section 19(2) and 
Schedule 1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
67. The landlord agrees that he was paid the bond by WINZ and tried to lodge it but 
because he had paid the owner his bond, he was told that he could not lodge a 
bond for this tenancy.
68. The bond centre confirms that there is no bond lodged with this address and the 
owner confirmed that he had not lodged the first bond.
69. The landlord could have lodged the bond and failed to. When asked where the 
money was, he said it was long gone and put toward the tenants costs and rent 
arrears he believed that the tenant owed. He did not have the funds now to cover 
the bond.
70.  I find they have committed an unlawful act.71. Where a party has committed an unlawful act intentionally, the Tribunal may 
award exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having 
regard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other 
party, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.
72. In consideration of the section 109(3) RTA,I find that this was an intentional 
breach. A bond is not the landlords money but the tenants to be held in trust by 
the bond centre for end of tenancy claims. The landlord has used the tenant’s 
money and confirmed that none of it is left.
73. The landlord said that he was a first-time landlord and did not know the 
requirements of the RTA. This is no excuse; it is the responsibility of a landlord 
to know and comply with the requirements of the RTA.
74. The consequence for the tenant is that she could not access the bond money for 
which she could be held liable to repay to WINZ.
75. It is in the public interest that tenants bond money is held by an independent bond 
centre as security for all parties.
76. I find it just to make an award of $250.00.
Bond refund
77. The tenant has applied for refund of the bond.  The landlord has a claim against 
the bond, but has not filed a counterclaim with Tenancy Services.  
78. Section 22B(2) Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that, where a tenant 
applies for refund of the bond, and the landlord seeks payment from the bond, 
the landlord must file an application setting out the details of the counterclaim. 
79.  Because the landlord has not filed a counterclaim the bond is refunded in full to 
the tenant.
Fencing
80. The tenant claimed that the premises were not fully fenced for children and that 
this was agreed upon. The premises were located down a long driveway and 
were situated on a working farm. There was an incident where a child was found 
down the road.
81. There was no evidence that the parties agreed this was a term of the tenancy.
82. This claim is dismissed.
Gardens
83. The tenant said that she was told her rent included the lawns being mown and 
the gardens being done. This never happened. The landlord said that this was not agreed to but the owner and himself mowed the lawns on occasions and when 
asked.
84. There was no evidence provided that the rent included lawn and garden 
maintenance. This claim is dismissed. 
85. Because [The tenant/s] has substantially succeeded with the claim I have 
reimbursed the filing fee.

TENANCY ADDRESS: 9 Maungakawa Road, Cambridge, Cambridge 3496
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the Tenant name and identifying details.
2. Daniel Hannibal and Warwick John Kiely must pay [The tenant/s] $4,820.44 
immediately, calculated as shown in table below:
Description Landlord Tenant
Rent arrears $50.00  
Filing fee reimbursement  $20.44
Exemplary damages: Failure  to lodge bond  $250.00
Refund bond  $2,800.00
Exemplary damages: HHS breach  $1,800.00
Total award $50.00 $4,870.44
Net award  $4,820.44
Total payable by Landlord to Tenant  $4,820.44Reasons:
1. All the parties attended the hearing. The tenant appeared with a support person.
2. The owner, Mr Kiely, purchased the property in August 2022 and agreed to rent 
it to Mr Hannibal and his partner
3. For the clarity I will refer to  Mr Kiely as the owner, Mr Hannibal as the landlord 
and  [The tenant/s], as the tenant.
4. The owner was not sure at the time of purchase if the premises complied with the 
Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) 2019 (HHS) due to its age, 
being 50 years old, and because he had not inspected it before renting it out. 
5. The premises are a 4-bedroom house with 10 acres of land and shedding. The 
landlord then signed a tenancy agreement with the tenant renting out the house. 
The owner consented to this. The landlord continued to rent the balance of the  
land and sheds for his stock off the owner. 
6. The tenancy agreement listed Mr Hannibal as the ‘landlord’ and [The tenant/s] as 
the ‘tenant’. The start date of this tenancy was 5 November 2022. The tenant 
received support for the tenancy through WINZ and the landlord became a 
registered supplier to them receiving the bond and two weeks rent in advance.
7. Mr Hannibal said that he was told that he could not lodge the bond because there 
was already a bond paid for the premises, so he held on to the money.
8. During the tenancy the landlord used the bond money to cover costs and rent he 
found owing.
9. The tenant sought compensation, exemplary damages, refund of the bond 
following the end of the tenancy and reimbursement of the filling fee.
Is this tenancy assigned or was it sublet to the tenant?
10. The respondent landlord is the tenant of the property pursuant to a tenancy 
agreement with the owner. The issue is whether the tenancy was assigned or 
whether the landlord is a sub-landlord and the tenant a sub-tenant.
11. The Residential Tenancies Act 1983, RTA, defines assignment as a transfer to a 
person of all the rights that a tenant has under a tenancy agreement. See section 
2, RTA.
12. A tenant may assign a tenancy with the consent of the landlord. The effect of this 
is that from the date of the assignment, that is that the date a new tenancy begins, 
the outgoing tenant ceases to be responsible to the landlord for obligations 
imposed by the agreement and RTA. See section 43B,43C RTA13. A sub-tenancy however is a tenancy agreement between a tenant (sub-landlord) 
and another person (sub-tenant) where the tenant remains liable under a tenancy 
agreement to the landlord. 
14. A sub-tenant is the grantee of a tenancy with the right to occupy the premises 
exclusively or otherwise for rent, reflecting the definitions of ‘tenant and ‘tenancy’ 
in section2(1) of the RTA.
15. In the current circumstances a tenancy agreement was signed by the parties. The 
start date of this tenancy was 5 November 2022. The landlord received tenancy 
entry costs from WINZ on 14 November 2022, communicated with the tenant, 
managed the tenancy and referred repairs and concerns to the owner. 
16. The landlord argued that this was a casual arrangement that he organised to help 
the tenant out. I disagree. He was fully involved with the tenancy from signing an 
agreement as the landlord, receiving rent and bond, being called on with the 
owner for repairs and lawn mowing. The tenant had exclusive rights to occupy 
the premises.
17.  I find that this was a landlord tenant relationship, and that the premises were  
sublet to the tenant by the landlord. I dismiss the argument that this was a casual 
agreement between the parties. The tenancy is valid, and the RTA applies to all 
tenancies between a landlord and tenant. 
18. Both the owner and landlord were involved with the management of the tenancy 
and I find it appropriate to join the owner as a party to the proceedings.
19. For the clarity in this I will refer to  Mr Hannibal, as the landlord and  [The tenant/s], 
as the tenant.
How much is owing in rent?
20. The tenant disputed the amount claimed for rent arrears at the end of the tenancy. 
21. The rent record provided by the landlords stated $1100.00 owing at the end of 
the tenancy. The tenant agreed that she had not paid rent for the last two weeks 
rent for her tenancy.
22. On 14 November WINZ paid the landlord 3 payments of $2000.00, $800.00, and 
$400.00. On 8 November a further $1000.00 was paid. This was amounted to 
$2800.00 for the bond and $1400.00 for 2 weeks rent in advance.
23. A ‘bond record’ was supplied by the landlord and recorded a starting amount of 
$2800.00. The record showed where the landlord deducted rent owing from this 
amount.
24. The rent record did not record the $1400.00 payment from WINZ as 2 weeks rent 
in advance. 25. When this was taken into consideration the rent became $300.00 in credit. The 
parties agreed that the tenant owed half rent for the first week she was at the 
tenancy being $350.00. 
26. I find that the tenant owes $50.00 in rent arrears at the end of the tenancy.
How much is owed for water?
27. There was no individual water metre installed at the premises and  no way to 
determine the water use exclusively attributable to this tenancy. See section 39 
RTA.  The claim for compensation for water use Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
Heathy Homes standards.
28. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the landlord’s obligations 
under section 45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA), which 
requires compliance with the Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) 
2019 (HHS). [The tenant/s] considers that the landlord has failed to comply with 
the HHS ventilation standard, the HHS draught stopping standard and the HHS 
insulation standard.
29. The District Court has confirmed that when there are multiple claims for a breach 
under a single section (section 45 here), then only one order of exemplary 
damages can be made. I will therefore address the question of exemplary 
damages for all claimed section 45 breaches below.
Ventilation
30. The ventilation standard sets out minimum expectations around windows and 
doors, and in particular the area of doors and windows that are openable.  The 
standard also requires that each kitchen and bathroom have extractor fans 
installed with a minimum defined extraction capacity.  
31. The HHS does provide exemptions in specific circumstances.
32. The landlord and owner agreed that the premises did not have an extractor fan 
installed in the kitchen or the bathroom saying that the premises was rented on 
the condition that the tenant knew that it may not comply with the HHS.
33.  The landlord and owner confirmed that they relied on the tenant telling them what 
was wrong and then they would fix it immediately. They said money was not the 
issue but getting service people to attend was delayed due to increased 
demands.
34. The landlord took 5 months to install an extractor fan in the bathroom which was 
completed just before the tenancy ended. The kitchen range hood was still in the 
garage. I find that they have breached the ventilation standards.Draught stopping 
35. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the landlord’s obligations 
under section 45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 in relation to the 
HHS draught stopping standard.
36. The draught stopping standard requires that residential premises be free from 
unreasonable gaps and holes that are not an intentional part of the building, which 
allow draughts to arise.  
37. The windows in the main bedroom did not shut properly, some of the hinges were 
bent and there were gaps to the outside. The tenant said that it was a sunny warm 
house, but she needed to be able to open and shut the windows. She said that 
at the start of the tenancy she told the landlords partner about them,  but nothing 
was done. Photographs were provided in support.
38. The owner found a Facebook post later in the tenancy where the tenant raised 
concern about the standard of the premises and noted the problem with the 
windows. The owner organised to get them replaced. They were repaired on 2 
March 2023.The tenancy ended on 7 March 2023.
39. The landlord said that he did not know about the windows before this and they 
were waiting for the tenant to let them know what needed repairing. A tenant has 
the obligation to inform the landlord of any damages or repairs as soon as 
possible after a tenancy begins, but a landlord is required to comply with the HHS 
within 120 days of any tenancy that commenced after 28 August 2022.
40. When I consider this with the statement that the landlord had not looked at the 
premises before renting it out, I find that the landlord has breached the obligation 
comply with the HHS ventilation standard. 
Insulation
41. [The tenant/s] claims that the landlord has breached the obligations under section 
45(1)(bb) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 by failing to insulate the 
premises in accordance with the Residential Tenancies (Smoke Alarms and 
Insulation) Regulations 2016.
42. From 1 July 2019, all residential premises must be insulated to a minimum 
standard.  Where the premises were insulated before 1 July 2016, the ceiling 
insulation must have an R-value of at least 1.9 (or 1.5 for houses of a brick or 
concrete block construction).  The underfloor insulation must have an R-value of 
at least 0.9.  The insulation must be in reasonable condition.
43. Where insulation is installed after 1 July 2016, the minimum R-value for ceiling 
insulation is 2.9 in Zones 1 and 2, and 3.3 for Zone 3 (Zone 3 covers the South 
Island and central North Island).  The minimum R-value for underfloor insulation 
is 1.3.44. There are exceptions to these requirements, for example, where it is not 
reasonably practicable, or where there is a habitable space above or below the 
ceiling or floor that would otherwise have to be insulated.
45. The parties agreed that the premises were not insulated.
46. I find they have committed an unlawful act by breaching the ventilation standard 
the draught standard and the insulation standard.
47. Where a party has committed an unlawful act intentionally, the Tribunal may 
award exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having 
regard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other 
party, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) RTA. 
48. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages may 
be awarded up to a maximum of $7,200.00.  See section 45 (1)(A) and Schedule 
1A RTA.
49. Over and above the requirement to comply with the Healthy Homes Standards, 
landlords are to provide and maintain premises in a reasonable state of repair. 
See Section 45 (1)(b). 
50. In considering the requirements of section 109(3)RTA  I conclude that by not 
looking at the premises before renting them out, and stating that they probably 
do not comply, that the landlord and owner have ignored their responsibilities. 
Ignorance is no excuse for noncompliance.
51. It is not the role of the tenant to alert the landlord to their noncompliance with the 
requirements of the RTA or HHS. There is a positive obligation on the landlord to 
comply.
52.  I find that these breaches are intentional. This is strengthened by the reliance on 
the tenant to tell the landlord and owner what was wrong with the premises. This 
hands-off approach does not absolve the parties from their responsibilities.
53. The effect of the unlawful acts for the tenant was a draughty and possibly a 
premises unable to be secured. Without extractor fans mould is far more likely to 
occur and homes with windows that do not seal are very hard to heat. The legal 
requirement to provide a warm insulated healthy home for tenants is what the 
HHS have been introduced for and this is in the public interest.  
54. I consider it just to make an order.
55. The maximum award for breaching this section 45 (1A) is $7,200.00 and there 
have been three breaches of this section. I find it just to award an order of 25% 
of the maximum, being an order of $1800.00.
Was there a breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment.?57. A landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace, comfort or privacy of the 
tenant in their use of the premises.  See section 38(2) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
58. Breaching this obligation in circumstances that amount to harassment is an 
unlawful act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of 
$3,000.00.  See section 38(3) and Schedule 1A RTA.
59. Harassment means ""to trouble, worry or distress"" or ""to wear out, tire, or exhaust"" 
and ""indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person"".  
MacDonald v Dodds, CIV-2009-019-001524, DC Hamilton, 26 February 2010.
60. The tenant provided a text from landlord’s partner saying that she had to leave 
because she had people at her property that the landlord did not like. This was 
later changed.
61. The landlord also sent the tenant a text saying that the ‘owner could do what the 
fuck he wants m8,he is the owner, so do what you have to.’ 
62. The texts were inappropriate and incorrect, but I do not find that these texts 
amount to a breach of the tenant’s quiet enjoyment amounting to harassment.
63. This claim is dismissed.
Bond
64. [The tenant/s] claims the landlord has not lodged the bond with the Bond Centre 
within the required time.
65. A landlord must send any bond payment to the Bond Centre within 23 working 
days after the payment is received.  See section 19(1) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
66. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which the Tribunal may award 
exemplary damages up to a maximum of $1,500.00.  See section 19(2) and 
Schedule 1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
67. The landlord agrees that he was paid the bond by WINZ and tried to lodge it but 
because he had paid the owner his bond, he was told that he could not lodge a 
bond for this tenancy.
68. The bond centre confirms that there is no bond lodged with this address and the 
owner confirmed that he had not lodged the first bond.
69. The landlord could have lodged the bond and failed to. When asked where the 
money was, he said it was long gone and put toward the tenants costs and rent 
arrears he believed that the tenant owed. He did not have the funds now to cover 
the bond.
70.  I find they have committed an unlawful act.71. Where a party has committed an unlawful act intentionally, the Tribunal may 
award exemplary damages where it is satisfied it would be just to do so, having 
regard to the party’s intent, the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other 
party, and the public interest.  See section 109(3) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.
72. In consideration of the section 109(3) RTA,I find that this was an intentional 
breach. A bond is not the landlords money but the tenants to be held in trust by 
the bond centre for end of tenancy claims. The landlord has used the tenant’s 
money and confirmed that none of it is left.
73. The landlord said that he was a first-time landlord and did not know the 
requirements of the RTA. This is no excuse; it is the responsibility of a landlord 
to know and comply with the requirements of the RTA.
74. The consequence for the tenant is that she could not access the bond money for 
which she could be held liable to repay to WINZ.
75. It is in the public interest that tenants bond money is held by an independent bond 
centre as security for all parties.
76. I find it just to make an award of $250.00.
Bond refund
77. The tenant has applied for refund of the bond.  The landlord has a claim against 
the bond, but has not filed a counterclaim with Tenancy Services.  
78. Section 22B(2) Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that, where a tenant 
applies for refund of the bond, and the landlord seeks payment from the bond, 
the landlord must file an application setting out the details of the counterclaim. 
79.  Because the landlord has not filed a counterclaim the bond is refunded in full to 
the tenant.
Fencing
80. The tenant claimed that the premises were not fully fenced for children and that 
this was agreed upon. The premises were located down a long driveway and 
were situated on a working farm. There was an incident where a child was found 
down the road.
81. There was no evidence that the parties agreed this was a term of the tenancy.
82. This claim is dismissed.
Gardens
83. The tenant said that she was told her rent included the lawns being mown and 
the gardens being done. This never happened. The landlord said that this was not agreed to but the owner and himself mowed the lawns on occasions and when 
asked.
84. There was no evidence provided that the rent included lawn and garden 
maintenance. This claim is dismissed. 
85. Because [The tenant/s] has substantially succeeded with the claim I have 
reimbursed the filing fee.

RESPONDENT: [The respondent/s]
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: [Tenancy address suppressed]
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the names and identifying details of both parties.
2. [The tenant/s] must pay [The landlord/s] $870.44 immediately, as calculated 
below:
Rent arrears to 15 September 2023 (consent) $850.00
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44
Amount owed by tenant to landlord $870.44
3. The application for compensation for damage is dismissed.
4. The application for termination of the tenancy is withdrawn.
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing. The landlord was represented by the 
property manager who manages the tenancy.2. The landlord has applied for an order terminating the tenancy for continuing 
breaches by the tenant failing to pay rent when due, rent arrears and 
compensation for damage done to part of the neighbouring property owned by 
the same landlord.
3. The landlord did not pursue the application for termination today. I have 
recorded the withdrawal of that part of the application.
Rent arrears
4. The tenancy is a long tenancy by New Zealand standards; it began on 30 
September 2017.
5. For most of the duration of the tenancy the rent has been paid on time or has 
been in credit.
6. The tenant has experienced some recent difficulties which have resulted in rent 
arrears. She is confident that she can continue to manage her weekly rent but 
cannot immediately meet her rent arrears.
7. The tenant accepted the amount of rent owing. I have made a rent arrears order 
by consent.
8. If the rent arrears are not paid, the tenant risks having the tenancy terminated 
should the landlord apply again.
Can the Tribunal award compensation for damage?
9. The landlord seeks compensation (the insurance excess and other costs 
amounting to $1,189.50) as a result of a former friend of the tenant leaving the 
premises in his car and damaging the fence and wheelie bin of the neighbouring 
property, also owned by the same landlord.
10. Section 40(2)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) provides that the 
tenant shall not intentionally, or carelessly damage, or permit any other person 
to damage, the premises. Premises is defined in section 2 RTA to include any 
part of any premises.
11. Section 41 RTA sets out a tenant’s responsibility for the actions of others.  A 
tenant is responsible for any intentional or careless damage to the premises 
while the tenant is in the premises. There is a presumption that the tenant 
permitted the other person to be in the premises, although the tenant can rebut 
that presumption.
12. Here, the tenant did not damage the premises, nor did she permit her former 
friend to damage the premises. That person has caused damage to another 
property. 13. The fact that the other property is owned by the same landlord does not make 
this tenant liable. The damage was not done to the premises (the tenancy 
premises), it was done to another property.
14. The issue of liability for the damage done to the other property (even though 
owned by the same owner as the tenancy premises at issue here) is a civil 
dispute between the property owner and the person who caused the damage.
15. The Tribunal cannot make an order against this tenant for damage done by a 
third party to another property.
16. The application for compensation for damage is dismissed.
Result
17. The tenant will pay the landlord $870.44 comprising rent arrears of $850.00 and 
the Tribunal filing fee of $20.44.
18. The application for compensation is dismissed.
19. The application for termination of the tenancy is withdrawn.
Name suppression
20. Both parties applied for a name suppression order. Each party has succeeded 
in part. There is no public interest in this order being published. The parties 
have had a long landlord/ tenant relationship, hopefully one that will continue. I 
have therefore made a name suppression order for both parties.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - [Event location suppressed]
APPLICANT: [The applicant/s]
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: [The respondent/s]
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: [Tenancy address suppressed]
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the names and identifying details of both parties.
2. [The tenant/s] must pay [The landlord/s] $870.44 immediately, as calculated 
below:
Rent arrears to 15 September 2023 (consent) $850.00
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44
Amount owed by tenant to landlord $870.44
3. The application for compensation for damage is dismissed.
4. The application for termination of the tenancy is withdrawn.
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing. The landlord was represented by the 
property manager who manages the tenancy.2. The landlord has applied for an order terminating the tenancy for continuing 
breaches by the tenant failing to pay rent when due, rent arrears and 
compensation for damage done to part of the neighbouring property owned by 
the same landlord.
3. The landlord did not pursue the application for termination today. I have 
recorded the withdrawal of that part of the application.
Rent arrears
4. The tenancy is a long tenancy by New Zealand standards; it began on 30 
September 2017.
5. For most of the duration of the tenancy the rent has been paid on time or has 
been in credit.
6. The tenant has experienced some recent difficulties which have resulted in rent 
arrears. She is confident that she can continue to manage her weekly rent but 
cannot immediately meet her rent arrears.
7. The tenant accepted the amount of rent owing. I have made a rent arrears order 
by consent.
8. If the rent arrears are not paid, the tenant risks having the tenancy terminated 
should the landlord apply again.
Can the Tribunal award compensation for damage?
9. The landlord seeks compensation (the insurance excess and other costs 
amounting to $1,189.50) as a result of a former friend of the tenant leaving the 
premises in his car and damaging the fence and wheelie bin of the neighbouring 
property, also owned by the same landlord.
10. Section 40(2)(a) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) provides that the 
tenant shall not intentionally, or carelessly damage, or permit any other person 
to damage, the premises. Premises is defined in section 2 RTA to include any 
part of any premises.
11. Section 41 RTA sets out a tenant’s responsibility for the actions of others.  A 
tenant is responsible for any intentional or careless damage to the premises 
while the tenant is in the premises. There is a presumption that the tenant 
permitted the other person to be in the premises, although the tenant can rebut 
that presumption.
12. Here, the tenant did not damage the premises, nor did she permit her former 
friend to damage the premises. That person has caused damage to another 
property. 13. The fact that the other property is owned by the same landlord does not make 
this tenant liable. The damage was not done to the premises (the tenancy 
premises), it was done to another property.
14. The issue of liability for the damage done to the other property (even though 
owned by the same owner as the tenancy premises at issue here) is a civil 
dispute between the property owner and the person who caused the damage.
15. The Tribunal cannot make an order against this tenant for damage done by a 
third party to another property.
16. The application for compensation for damage is dismissed.
Result
17. The tenant will pay the landlord $870.44 comprising rent arrears of $850.00 and 
the Tribunal filing fee of $20.44.
18. The application for compensation is dismissed.
19. The application for termination of the tenancy is withdrawn.
Name suppression
20. Both parties applied for a name suppression order. Each party has succeeded 
in part. There is no public interest in this order being published. The parties 
have had a long landlord/ tenant relationship, hopefully one that will continue. I 
have therefore made a name suppression order for both parties.

APPLICANT: [The applicant/s]
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: Tony Gover, Bob Gover, Natara Gover
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: 95A Papaiti Road, Papaiti, RD 14, Whanganui 4584
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the landlord’s name and identifying details.
2. [The landlord/s] is granted possession of the premises at 95A Papaiti Road, 
Papaiti, RD 14, Whanganui 4584 on Friday 22 September 2023 at 11.59pm.
3. Tony Gover, Bob Gover and Natara Gover must pay [The landlord/s] the sum of 
$20.44 immediately.
Reasons:
1. The landlord attended the hearing. There were no appearances from any of the 
tenants.
2. The landlord has applied for termination of the tenancy for breach of the 
tenant’s obligations.
Should the tenancy be terminated?
3. The Tribunal may terminate a tenancy for breach where, due to the nature or 
extent of the breach, it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate.  See section 
56(1) Residential Tenancies Act 1986.  4. Where the breach is capable of remedy the landlord must first serve a notice on 
the tenant requiring them to remedy the breach within at least 14 days and 
establish that the tenant has failed to do so.
5. The tenant has breached their obligations by changing the locks and removing 
security cameras.
6. The landlord served a 14-day notice on the tenant on 1 August 2023 and the 
tenant did not remedy the breach within the required period, and has still not 
done so.
7. It would be inequitable to refuse to terminate the tenancy because under 
section 46 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 neither party may change the 
locks without the consent of the other party. The tenant has refused to give the 
landlord a key and has told her that if she changes the lock, he will change 
them back again. A breach of section 46 is an unlawful act under the Act.
8. The landlord is unable to conduct proper inspections of the house and the 
tenant will not allow her to look in one room of the house. Because she does not 
have a key, she cannot enter the premises as she is entitled to within the terms 
of section 48 of the Act. This is unacceptable. It would be inequitable to refuse 
to terminate the tenancy.
9. The landlord outlined other breaches, some of which have been remedied. She 
also described some being shot in the face and back with a BB gun by 
[redacted]. The landlord could have terminated the tenancy under section 
55AA(1)(a) because of assault. It is suggested that in future she speaks with 
Tenancy Services about any issues or she retains the services of a Property 
Manager.
10. Because [The landlord/s] has wholly succeeded with the claim I must reimburse 
the filing fee.

TENANCY ADDRESS: [Tenancy address suppressed]
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the landlord’s name and identifying details.
2. The tenancy of Jeremy Donald Harcourt at [Tenancy address suppressed] is 
terminated, and possession is granted to [The landlord/s] immediately.
Reasons:
1. The hearing was conducted by telephone. The landlord attended. The tenant 
did not attend. The call to his mobile telephone number went to voice mail.
2. This tenancy began in April 2023. The landlord owns the two storied house 
which is [Tenancy address suppressed]. Half of the ground floor of the house is 
a self-contained flat and the landlord agreed to rent the flat to the tenant at a 
rent of $225 per week.
3. Shortly after the tenancy began, the landlord employed the tenant to work for 
him. In August, the landlord gave the tenant notice to end his employment 
because he was ceasing business. On 15 August, during the notice period, he 
asked the tenant to undergo a drug test. The tenant refused and there was an 
altercation during which the tenant threatened to burn down the landlord’s 
house.4. The landlord reported the threat to the Police who, the landlord said, have 
charged the tenant. It seems that it is a condition of the tenant’s bail that he is 
not to enter the premises or come near it. In any case, he is prohibited from 
doing so and he has not been back to the premises, and he has not paid rent. 
His belongings are still in the premises.
5. Section 55(1)(b) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (the Act) states that the 
Tribunal must make an order terminating the tenancy where it is satisfied that 
the tenant has threatened to cause substantial damage to the premises. I am 
satisfied that he has done so.
6. In any case, it is impossible for the tenancy to continue because the tenant is 
prohibited from entering the premises. It is therefore in both parties’ interests 
that the tenancy is ended.
7. I have therefore made an order for immediate termination of the tenancy and 
granted the landlord possession of the premises.
8. The landlord must now comply with his obligations under the Act in respect of 
dealing with the tenant’s belongings left at the premises.
9. The landlord did not seek an order for the payment of money.

Filing fee reimbursement $20.44  
Total award $6,645.44  
Bond $1,650.00  
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $4,995.44  
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.
2. The property is large six-bedroom home in Mangere. The tenants lived there from 
2012 to 2023.  At the beginning of the tenancy the house had been completely 
renovated, new paint, new carpet, new bathroom vanity, shower etc.
3. The tenancy ended after the landlord gave the tenants a 90 day notice to end the 
tenancy so that the landlord could do major repairs and sell the property.
4. One of the reasons that the landlord gave the tenant notice was so that it could 
re-roof the property before selling. The landlord did this work after the tenants 
left.
Accepted claims 
5. The tenants accept the landlord’s claims for rent arrears and window repairs.
Disputed claims
6. The landlord’s claims are for cleaning and damage to the property. The tenant 
disputes liability for the cleaning and repairs for the following reasons:
a) The tenant says that much of the damage claimed for items like carpets, 
curtains wardrobe doors, painting etc is fair wear and tear that would be 
expected over a tenancy of 11 years.
b) The tenant says that the landlord is seeking to improve the property for sale 
at the tenant’s cost.
c) That some of the damage occurred at the beginning of the tenancy, such as 
the removal of the laundry tub (due to the tenant’s washing machine being too 
big to fit in the space and that the landlord knew about this but did nothing 
about it.
d) That the tenants thought that the landlord was undertaking major repairs and 
therefore they did not need to clean it thoroughly.
e) That the landlord spent very little on the property over 11 years and that the 
tenants looked after repairs themselves.f) That the tenant improved the property by installing a heat pump which they 
have not been given credit for.
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
7. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all 
chattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential 
Tenancies Act 1986.  .
8.  I am satisfied from the photographs provided by the landlord and the description 
of the work undertaken in the cleaning invoice that the tenant did not leave the 
premises reasonably clean and tidy and did not remove all rubbish.
9. I do not accept the tenant’s submission that they did not need to leave the 
property clean because the landlord was renovating. The nature and the extent 
of the dirtiness boarded on unhygienic (such as dog faeces being left on the 
carpet) and I do not consider that it appropriate to leave the property in the state 
that was simply because the landlord was intending on doing repairs.
10.  I am also satisfied that the tenant removed curtains and tracks. I record that I 
would not have expected all curtains to have been at the end of their life after 12 
years and, even if this was the case, the tracks should still be up.
11.  I am satisfied that the costs sought by the landlord are appropriate. The amount 
for the skip bin was a percentage of the total costs incurred by the landlord and 
is reasonable. The landlord used the skip bin for other reasons such as  removal 
of building  waste which the tenant has not been charged for.
12. The amounts ordered are proved.
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
13. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
14. Where the damage is careless, and occurs after 27 August 2019, section 49B 
RTA applies.  If the landlord becomes aware of the damage after 27 August, the 
damage is presumed to have occurred after that date unless the tenant proves 
otherwise.  
15. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord's 
insurance, the tenant's liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or four weeks' rent (or four weeks' market rent in the case of a tenant paying income-
related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  
16. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, 
the tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent).  See section 
49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the tenant's 
conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the damage.  See 
section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.
17. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
18. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
Carpets 
19.  I am satisfied that the damage to the carpets is intentional. The tenant kept a 
dog at the property in breach of the agreement and the landlord issues a 14 day 
notice for a dog in 2020, which the tenant complied with, however in an inspection 
in 2022, the landlord found a dog locked a bedroom. It is this bedroom where the 
carpet was ripped by the dog and where the landlord found dog faeces after the 
tenant moved out. 
20. The tenant accepts that the dog has caused damage but says that carpet is old 
and was nearing the end of its life.
21. The landlord has only claimed a percentage of the total cost of the replacement 
carpet. The amount asked for is for the part of the carpet in the bedroom which 
was intentionally damaged.
22. I am satisfied that the damage ion the bedroom  is intentional. The tenant was in 
breach of his agreement and thy knew that damage was occurring and took no 
steps to rectify it. 
23. Carpet in bedrooms is expected to last up to 15 years. I accept the landlord’s 
evidence that they have replaced the whole of the carpet in the house but are 
seeking are lesser amount taking into account depreciation and betterment. I 
have taken into account depreciation and betterment and have awarded the 
landlord $1000.00 in particular this takes into account that the landlord has had 
to replace the carpet earlier than it otherwise would have as a result of the 
tenant’s actions.
Holes in the wall and painting.24.  The landlord says that the tenant left numerous holes in the walls and graffiti  on 
the walls. The tenant says that it repaired all of the holes in the walls, and they 
just needed painting. I consider the holes in the walls and the graffiti intentional. 
However, when I take into account the age of the paint work and the number of 
people in the home then I consider that the house was nearing a time that it would 
have needed repainting.  I accept that the landlord would have needed to do 
some preparatory work before the property was painted, especially in areas 
where the tenant had plastered over holes.
25. There are some holes in the property that were over 6 years old. The time frame 
for bringing a claim to the tribunal is 6 years.
26. Taking all the above into account the amounts awarded are proven.
Other damage claimed 
27. I consider that the tenant also broke the wardrobe doors, broke some of the door 
frames, deliberately removed the laundry tub causing damage, broke the toilet 
cistern, removed the towel rails and toilet roll holders and scratched the bathtub 
and broke light fittings. 
28. The damage is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved 
liability for the damage.
29. The amounts ordered are proved. I have taken into account betterment and 
depreciation.  The landlord should be returned to the position they would have 
been in had the tenant not breached their obligations and should not be better or 
worse off.  In calculating depreciation, I have taken into account the age and 
condition of the items at the start of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan. I 
have reduced some of the landlord’s claimed costs to better reflect the 
depreciation and the nature and extent of the damage.
Claims not proven
30. I do not consider the tenant should be responsible for acid washing the driveway, 
there was no evidence provided by the landlord to show that this was necessary.
31. There was also no evidence to support the landlord’s claims for 3 new doors. 
There were pictures of all the doors at the beginning of the tenancy, and the age 
of the doors in the house suggests that they are nearing the end of their lifespan.
32. Because Jamaliyeh Drake has substantially succeeded with the claim I have 
reimbursed the filing fee.

Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $4,995.44  
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.
2. The property is large six-bedroom home in Mangere. The tenants lived there from 
2012 to 2023.  At the beginning of the tenancy the house had been completely 
renovated, new paint, new carpet, new bathroom vanity, shower etc.
3. The tenancy ended after the landlord gave the tenants a 90 day notice to end the 
tenancy so that the landlord could do major repairs and sell the property.
4. One of the reasons that the landlord gave the tenant notice was so that it could 
re-roof the property before selling. The landlord did this work after the tenants 
left.
Accepted claims 
5. The tenants accept the landlord’s claims for rent arrears and window repairs.
Disputed claims
6. The landlord’s claims are for cleaning and damage to the property. The tenant 
disputes liability for the cleaning and repairs for the following reasons:
a) The tenant says that much of the damage claimed for items like carpets, 
curtains wardrobe doors, painting etc is fair wear and tear that would be 
expected over a tenancy of 11 years.
b) The tenant says that the landlord is seeking to improve the property for sale 
at the tenant’s cost.
c) That some of the damage occurred at the beginning of the tenancy, such as 
the removal of the laundry tub (due to the tenant’s washing machine being too 
big to fit in the space and that the landlord knew about this but did nothing 
about it.
d) That the tenants thought that the landlord was undertaking major repairs and 
therefore they did not need to clean it thoroughly.
e) That the landlord spent very little on the property over 11 years and that the 
tenants looked after repairs themselves.f) That the tenant improved the property by installing a heat pump which they 
have not been given credit for.
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
7. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all 
chattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential 
Tenancies Act 1986.  .
8.  I am satisfied from the photographs provided by the landlord and the description 
of the work undertaken in the cleaning invoice that the tenant did not leave the 
premises reasonably clean and tidy and did not remove all rubbish.
9. I do not accept the tenant’s submission that they did not need to leave the 
property clean because the landlord was renovating. The nature and the extent 
of the dirtiness boarded on unhygienic (such as dog faeces being left on the 
carpet) and I do not consider that it appropriate to leave the property in the state 
that was simply because the landlord was intending on doing repairs.
10.  I am also satisfied that the tenant removed curtains and tracks. I record that I 
would not have expected all curtains to have been at the end of their life after 12 
years and, even if this was the case, the tracks should still be up.
11.  I am satisfied that the costs sought by the landlord are appropriate. The amount 
for the skip bin was a percentage of the total costs incurred by the landlord and 
is reasonable. The landlord used the skip bin for other reasons such as  removal 
of building  waste which the tenant has not been charged for.
12. The amounts ordered are proved.
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
13. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
14. Where the damage is careless, and occurs after 27 August 2019, section 49B 
RTA applies.  If the landlord becomes aware of the damage after 27 August, the 
damage is presumed to have occurred after that date unless the tenant proves 
otherwise.  
15. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord's 
insurance, the tenant's liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or four weeks' rent (or four weeks' market rent in the case of a tenant paying income-
related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  
16. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, 
the tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent).  See section 
49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the tenant's 
conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the damage.  See 
section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.
17. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
18. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
Carpets 
19.  I am satisfied that the damage to the carpets is intentional. The tenant kept a 
dog at the property in breach of the agreement and the landlord issues a 14 day 
notice for a dog in 2020, which the tenant complied with, however in an inspection 
in 2022, the landlord found a dog locked a bedroom. It is this bedroom where the 
carpet was ripped by the dog and where the landlord found dog faeces after the 
tenant moved out. 
20. The tenant accepts that the dog has caused damage but says that carpet is old 
and was nearing the end of its life.
21. The landlord has only claimed a percentage of the total cost of the replacement 
carpet. The amount asked for is for the part of the carpet in the bedroom which 
was intentionally damaged.
22. I am satisfied that the damage ion the bedroom  is intentional. The tenant was in 
breach of his agreement and thy knew that damage was occurring and took no 
steps to rectify it. 
23. Carpet in bedrooms is expected to last up to 15 years. I accept the landlord’s 
evidence that they have replaced the whole of the carpet in the house but are 
seeking are lesser amount taking into account depreciation and betterment. I 
have taken into account depreciation and betterment and have awarded the 
landlord $1000.00 in particular this takes into account that the landlord has had 
to replace the carpet earlier than it otherwise would have as a result of the 
tenant’s actions.
Holes in the wall and painting.24.  The landlord says that the tenant left numerous holes in the walls and graffiti  on 
the walls. The tenant says that it repaired all of the holes in the walls, and they 
just needed painting. I consider the holes in the walls and the graffiti intentional. 
However, when I take into account the age of the paint work and the number of 
people in the home then I consider that the house was nearing a time that it would 
have needed repainting.  I accept that the landlord would have needed to do 
some preparatory work before the property was painted, especially in areas 
where the tenant had plastered over holes.
25. There are some holes in the property that were over 6 years old. The time frame 
for bringing a claim to the tribunal is 6 years.
26. Taking all the above into account the amounts awarded are proven.
Other damage claimed 
27. I consider that the tenant also broke the wardrobe doors, broke some of the door 
frames, deliberately removed the laundry tub causing damage, broke the toilet 
cistern, removed the towel rails and toilet roll holders and scratched the bathtub 
and broke light fittings. 
28. The damage is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved 
liability for the damage.
29. The amounts ordered are proved. I have taken into account betterment and 
depreciation.  The landlord should be returned to the position they would have 
been in had the tenant not breached their obligations and should not be better or 
worse off.  In calculating depreciation, I have taken into account the age and 
condition of the items at the start of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan. I 
have reduced some of the landlord’s claimed costs to better reflect the 
depreciation and the nature and extent of the damage.
Claims not proven
30. I do not consider the tenant should be responsible for acid washing the driveway, 
there was no evidence provided by the landlord to show that this was necessary.
31. There was also no evidence to support the landlord’s claims for 3 new doors. 
There were pictures of all the doors at the beginning of the tenancy, and the age 
of the doors in the house suggests that they are nearing the end of their lifespan.
32. Because Jamaliyeh Drake has substantially succeeded with the claim I have 
reimbursed the filing fee.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - Manukau
APPLICANT: Lalit Singh, Musarat Zabeen
 Occupants/Tenants
RESPONDENT: Permila Devi Ram
 Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: 18 Cambourne Road, Papatoetoe, Auckland 2025
ORDER
The application is struck out for want of jurisdiction. 
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.
2. The Landlord argues that s 5(1)(n) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 
(“the Act”) applies and excludes this tenancy from the provisions of the Act.
3. Just prior to the hearing I told the parties I would hear and determine the 
issue of jurisdiction first, before hearing the substantive claim. I reiterated 
this at the hearing. 
4. For the reasons outlined below, I am satisfied s 5(1)(n) applies. 
Consequently, there is no residential tenancy to which the Act applies.The law
1. Section 4 of the Act reads:
“This Act applies to every tenancy for residential purposes except as specifically 
provided.” 
Prima facie, the premises at 18 Cambourne Road, Papatoetoe (the 
premises) were used for residential purposes and as such as a starting 
point is covered by the Act, unless a section 5 exemption applies, and the 
parties did not contract back into the Act.
2. “Tenancy” is defined in section 2 of the Act as follows:
“tenancy, in relation to any residential premises, means the right to occupy the 
premises (whether exclusively or otherwise) in consideration for rent; and 
includes any tenancy of residential premises implied or created by any 
enactment; and, where appropriate, also includes a former tenancy ….”. 
3. The Landlord argued that money was paid by the Occupants/Tenants in 
exchange for occupancy rights and not as rent for tenancy. The 
Occupants/Tenants argued that they paid rent and had a verbal residential 
tenancy agreement with the Permila Ram Trust (the Trust) in exchange for 
$400 per week for the first month, and $500 per week thereafter.  
4. The exceptions to the Act are contained in s 5. Relevantly, s 5(1)(n) of the Act 
provides:
“…where the premises, not being a boarding house, continue to be used, during 
the tenancy, principally as a place of residence by the landlord or the owner of the 
premises or by any member of the landlord’s or owner’s family.”
5. Under s 5 of the Act, member of the landlord's or owner's family means 
any person who is related to the landlord or owner by blood, or through 
marriage, a civil union, or a de facto relationship; or by adoption.
6. Section 2 of the Act, defines a landlord as “in relation to any residential 
premises that are subject to a tenancy agreement, means the grantor of a 
tenancy of the premises under the agreement…”
7. The Trust, through its trustee Ms Ram, granted tenancy of the premises 
to the Occupants/Tenants, as members of her family. Ms Ram kept some 
of her possessions at the premises and occupied a bedroom when she 
was at home. She also intended to live with the Occupants/Tenants as a 
family unit on a more full-time basis in the future. 
8. Section 10 of the Act states:
“Where, in any proceedings before the Tribunal, any party contends that this Act 
does not apply in respect of any tenancy of any residential premises, it shall be for that party to establish the facts upon which it is contended that this Act does not 
apply.”
9. So, in the present case, the Landlord must prove, on the balance of 
probabilities, that s 5(1)(n) applies. This requires the landlord to prove that 
Ms Ram is the landlord and owner of the premises, and that Mr Singh and 
Mrs Zabeen are members of the landlord's or owner's family.
Who is the landlord or owner of the residential premises
5. A trust is not a separate legal entity, the trustees own the trust assets of any 
family trust, for the benefit of the beneficiaries.
6. The trustees of the Trust own the premises. Ms Ram is the settlor of this Trust, 
a co-trustee and a beneficiary that has a licence to occupy the premises and 
use it as her place of residence. She does not have to pay rent if she pays all 
the outgoings for the premises. As such, she is not a tenant for the purposes of 
the Act. Although Mr Alan McLean is a co-trustee and a co-owner/landlord of 
the premises, as Davidson J states in Lothbury Management Ltd v Ryan and 
Anor [2021] NZHC 2621 [1 October 2021] at [45]:
“…where two co-owners agree that the property is to be used by one of them as a 
place of residence, s5(1)(n) applies, and a residential tenancy governed by the Act is 
deemed not to exist”.
7. Whether the Occupants/Tenants are covered by the provisions of the Act, or are 
common law tenants, depends on whether they are family members of the 
Trustee landlord and legal owner of the premises.
Were the occupants/tenants members of the landlord's or owner's family
8. During the hearing, the parties confirmed that Mr Singh is Ms Ram’s sister’s son 
and her nephew. They are therefore related by blood. The parties also 
confirmed that Mrs Zabeen is married to Mr Singh and is therefore related to Ms 
Ram by marriage.
9. Ms Ram, as a co-trustee/landlord/owner, entered into a verbal agreement for Mr 
Singh and his wife to reside at the premises, in exchange for $400 a week for 
the first month and $500 per week thereafter.
10. Ms Ram says she entered into this verbal agreement, on the understanding that 
Mr Singh and Mrs Zabeen are her family members, one by blood and the other 
by marriage. Further, that they were not tenants but occupants that paid rent 
towards offsetting the outgoings of the premises, that Ms Ram has responsibility 
for covering as the holder of a licence to occupy and the main tenant.11. The Occupants/Tenants argues that they resided in the premises from around 
28 March 2016 to 29 October 2022, and they were tenants as they paid rent as 
well as outgoings. They also made payments towards the costs of renovating 
the premises, as well as supplying free labour to carry out the renovations.
12. Ms Ram argues:
a The Act does not apply to the Tenants/Occupants occupation of the 
premises because s 5(1)(n) of the Act applies.
b There is no residential tenancy, and therefore, no jurisdiction for the 
Tenancy Tribunal to hear this matter.
c Both occupants are members of the landlord's or owner's family, 
invoking the s 5 exclusion because:
i Mr Lalit Singh is Ms Ram’s sister’s son, a nephew and 
therefore a blood relative; and
ii Mrs Musarat Zabeen is Mr Lalit Singh’s wife and is therefore 
related to Ms Ram by marriage. 
d Further, Ms Ram made clear to the Occupants/Tenants that there 
was no binding tenancy agreement between them and the Trust 
when the Occupants/Tenants asked for tenancy agreement in April 
2016. She did so in her character reference letter, dated 28 April 
2016, stating that he and his wife were not tenants but occupants 
that paid rent to live in the family home, and they did not have a 
residential tenancy with the Trust because:
i Mr Singh is her “nephew”, “beneficiary” and “agent for the 
rental property”;
ii “Mr Singh and his wife moved into our family home on 21 
March with me and will continue to reside there until I return 
to New Zealand in a few months’ time”;
iii “Since the changes to my family Trustees, we as Permila 
Ram Trust has agreed not to have rental properties but 
families to live in them”;
iv “I intend to relive in my house 18 Cambourne Road from July 
2016 with my adopted son/nephew Lalit Singh and his wife 
Musarat Zabeen as a family unit”.
10. The parties agreed at the hearing that Mr Singh and his wife are members of 
the landlord's or owner's family, as required for the section 5(1)(n) exception in 
the Act to apply. Therefore, the Occupants/Tenants claim that they were 
tenants that are covered by the provisions of the Act must fail.Conclusion
11. The Tenancy Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear this matter and 
accordingly the claim is struck out for want of jurisdiction.
12. The Occupants/Tenants have not been wholly or substantially successful 
in their application. Therefore, their application for reimbursement of the 
filing fee is denied.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - Manukau
APPLICANT: Lalit Singh, Musarat Zabeen
 Occupants/Tenants
RESPONDENT: Permila Devi Ram
 Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: 18 Cambourne Road, Papatoetoe, Auckland 2025
ORDER
The application is struck out for want of jurisdiction. 
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.
2. The Landlord argues that s 5(1)(n) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 
(“the Act”) applies and excludes this tenancy from the provisions of the Act.
3. Just prior to the hearing I told the parties I would hear and determine the 
issue of jurisdiction first, before hearing the substantive claim. I reiterated 
this at the hearing. 
4. For the reasons outlined below, I am satisfied s 5(1)(n) applies. 
Consequently, there is no residential tenancy to which the Act applies.The law
1. Section 4 of the Act reads:
“This Act applies to every tenancy for residential purposes except as specifically 
provided.” 
Prima facie, the premises at 18 Cambourne Road, Papatoetoe (the 
premises) were used for residential purposes and as such as a starting 
point is covered by the Act, unless a section 5 exemption applies, and the 
parties did not contract back into the Act.
2. “Tenancy” is defined in section 2 of the Act as follows:
“tenancy, in relation to any residential premises, means the right to occupy the 
premises (whether exclusively or otherwise) in consideration for rent; and 
includes any tenancy of residential premises implied or created by any 
enactment; and, where appropriate, also includes a former tenancy ….”. 
3. The Landlord argued that money was paid by the Occupants/Tenants in 
exchange for occupancy rights and not as rent for tenancy. The 
Occupants/Tenants argued that they paid rent and had a verbal residential 
tenancy agreement with the Permila Ram Trust (the Trust) in exchange for 
$400 per week for the first month, and $500 per week thereafter.  
4. The exceptions to the Act are contained in s 5. Relevantly, s 5(1)(n) of the Act 
provides:
“…where the premises, not being a boarding house, continue to be used, during 
the tenancy, principally as a place of residence by the landlord or the owner of the 
premises or by any member of the landlord’s or owner’s family.”
5. Under s 5 of the Act, member of the landlord's or owner's family means 
any person who is related to the landlord or owner by blood, or through 
marriage, a civil union, or a de facto relationship; or by adoption.
6. Section 2 of the Act, defines a landlord as “in relation to any residential 
premises that are subject to a tenancy agreement, means the grantor of a 
tenancy of the premises under the agreement…”
7. The Trust, through its trustee Ms Ram, granted tenancy of the premises 
to the Occupants/Tenants, as members of her family. Ms Ram kept some 
of her possessions at the premises and occupied a bedroom when she 
was at home. She also intended to live with the Occupants/Tenants as a 
family unit on a more full-time basis in the future. 
8. Section 10 of the Act states:
“Where, in any proceedings before the Tribunal, any party contends that this Act 
does not apply in respect of any tenancy of any residential premises, it shall be for that party to establish the facts upon which it is contended that this Act does not 
apply.”
9. So, in the present case, the Landlord must prove, on the balance of 
probabilities, that s 5(1)(n) applies. This requires the landlord to prove that 
Ms Ram is the landlord and owner of the premises, and that Mr Singh and 
Mrs Zabeen are members of the landlord's or owner's family.
Who is the landlord or owner of the residential premises
5. A trust is not a separate legal entity, the trustees own the trust assets of any 
family trust, for the benefit of the beneficiaries.
6. The trustees of the Trust own the premises. Ms Ram is the settlor of this Trust, 
a co-trustee and a beneficiary that has a licence to occupy the premises and 
use it as her place of residence. She does not have to pay rent if she pays all 
the outgoings for the premises. As such, she is not a tenant for the purposes of 
the Act. Although Mr Alan McLean is a co-trustee and a co-owner/landlord of 
the premises, as Davidson J states in Lothbury Management Ltd v Ryan and 
Anor [2021] NZHC 2621 [1 October 2021] at [45]:
“…where two co-owners agree that the property is to be used by one of them as a 
place of residence, s5(1)(n) applies, and a residential tenancy governed by the Act is 
deemed not to exist”.
7. Whether the Occupants/Tenants are covered by the provisions of the Act, or are 
common law tenants, depends on whether they are family members of the 
Trustee landlord and legal owner of the premises.
Were the occupants/tenants members of the landlord's or owner's family
8. During the hearing, the parties confirmed that Mr Singh is Ms Ram’s sister’s son 
and her nephew. They are therefore related by blood. The parties also 
confirmed that Mrs Zabeen is married to Mr Singh and is therefore related to Ms 
Ram by marriage.
9. Ms Ram, as a co-trustee/landlord/owner, entered into a verbal agreement for Mr 
Singh and his wife to reside at the premises, in exchange for $400 a week for 
the first month and $500 per week thereafter.
10. Ms Ram says she entered into this verbal agreement, on the understanding that 
Mr Singh and Mrs Zabeen are her family members, one by blood and the other 
by marriage. Further, that they were not tenants but occupants that paid rent 
towards offsetting the outgoings of the premises, that Ms Ram has responsibility 
for covering as the holder of a licence to occupy and the main tenant.11. The Occupants/Tenants argues that they resided in the premises from around 
28 March 2016 to 29 October 2022, and they were tenants as they paid rent as 
well as outgoings. They also made payments towards the costs of renovating 
the premises, as well as supplying free labour to carry out the renovations.
12. Ms Ram argues:
a The Act does not apply to the Tenants/Occupants occupation of the 
premises because s 5(1)(n) of the Act applies.
b There is no residential tenancy, and therefore, no jurisdiction for the 
Tenancy Tribunal to hear this matter.
c Both occupants are members of the landlord's or owner's family, 
invoking the s 5 exclusion because:
i Mr Lalit Singh is Ms Ram’s sister’s son, a nephew and 
therefore a blood relative; and
ii Mrs Musarat Zabeen is Mr Lalit Singh’s wife and is therefore 
related to Ms Ram by marriage. 
d Further, Ms Ram made clear to the Occupants/Tenants that there 
was no binding tenancy agreement between them and the Trust 
when the Occupants/Tenants asked for tenancy agreement in April 
2016. She did so in her character reference letter, dated 28 April 
2016, stating that he and his wife were not tenants but occupants 
that paid rent to live in the family home, and they did not have a 
residential tenancy with the Trust because:
i Mr Singh is her “nephew”, “beneficiary” and “agent for the 
rental property”;
ii “Mr Singh and his wife moved into our family home on 21 
March with me and will continue to reside there until I return 
to New Zealand in a few months’ time”;
iii “Since the changes to my family Trustees, we as Permila 
Ram Trust has agreed not to have rental properties but 
families to live in them”;
iv “I intend to relive in my house 18 Cambourne Road from July 
2016 with my adopted son/nephew Lalit Singh and his wife 
Musarat Zabeen as a family unit”.
10. The parties agreed at the hearing that Mr Singh and his wife are members of 
the landlord's or owner's family, as required for the section 5(1)(n) exception in 
the Act to apply. Therefore, the Occupants/Tenants claim that they were 
tenants that are covered by the provisions of the Act must fail.Conclusion
11. The Tenancy Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear this matter and 
accordingly the claim is struck out for want of jurisdiction.
12. The Occupants/Tenants have not been wholly or substantially successful 
in their application. Therefore, their application for reimbursement of the 
filing fee is denied.

APPLICANT: Lalit Singh, Musarat Zabeen
 Occupants/Tenants
RESPONDENT: Permila Devi Ram
 Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: 18 Cambourne Road, Papatoetoe, Auckland 2025
ORDER
The application is struck out for want of jurisdiction. 
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.
2. The Landlord argues that s 5(1)(n) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 
(“the Act”) applies and excludes this tenancy from the provisions of the Act.
3. Just prior to the hearing I told the parties I would hear and determine the 
issue of jurisdiction first, before hearing the substantive claim. I reiterated 
this at the hearing. 
4. For the reasons outlined below, I am satisfied s 5(1)(n) applies. 
Consequently, there is no residential tenancy to which the Act applies.The law
1. Section 4 of the Act reads:
“This Act applies to every tenancy for residential purposes except as specifically 
provided.” 
Prima facie, the premises at 18 Cambourne Road, Papatoetoe (the 
premises) were used for residential purposes and as such as a starting 
point is covered by the Act, unless a section 5 exemption applies, and the 
parties did not contract back into the Act.
2. “Tenancy” is defined in section 2 of the Act as follows:
“tenancy, in relation to any residential premises, means the right to occupy the 
premises (whether exclusively or otherwise) in consideration for rent; and 
includes any tenancy of residential premises implied or created by any 
enactment; and, where appropriate, also includes a former tenancy ….”. 
3. The Landlord argued that money was paid by the Occupants/Tenants in 
exchange for occupancy rights and not as rent for tenancy. The 
Occupants/Tenants argued that they paid rent and had a verbal residential 
tenancy agreement with the Permila Ram Trust (the Trust) in exchange for 
$400 per week for the first month, and $500 per week thereafter.  
4. The exceptions to the Act are contained in s 5. Relevantly, s 5(1)(n) of the Act 
provides:
“…where the premises, not being a boarding house, continue to be used, during 
the tenancy, principally as a place of residence by the landlord or the owner of the 
premises or by any member of the landlord’s or owner’s family.”
5. Under s 5 of the Act, member of the landlord's or owner's family means 
any person who is related to the landlord or owner by blood, or through 
marriage, a civil union, or a de facto relationship; or by adoption.
6. Section 2 of the Act, defines a landlord as “in relation to any residential 
premises that are subject to a tenancy agreement, means the grantor of a 
tenancy of the premises under the agreement…”
7. The Trust, through its trustee Ms Ram, granted tenancy of the premises 
to the Occupants/Tenants, as members of her family. Ms Ram kept some 
of her possessions at the premises and occupied a bedroom when she 
was at home. She also intended to live with the Occupants/Tenants as a

“Where, in any proceedings before the Tribunal, any party contends that this Act 
does not apply in respect of any tenancy of any residential premises, it shall be for that party to establish the facts upon which it is contended that this Act does not 
apply.”
9. So, in the present case, the Landlord must prove, on the balance of 
probabilities, that s 5(1)(n) applies. This requires the landlord to prove that 
Ms Ram is the landlord and owner of the premises, and that Mr Singh and 
Mrs Zabeen are members of the landlord's or owner's family.
Who is the landlord or owner of the residential premises
5. A trust is not a separate legal entity, the trustees own the trust assets of any 
family trust, for the benefit of the beneficiaries.
6. The trustees of the Trust own the premises. Ms Ram is the settlor of this Trust, 
a co-trustee and a beneficiary that has a licence to occupy the premises and 
use it as her place of residence. She does not have to pay rent if she pays all 
the outgoings for the premises. As such, she is not a tenant for the purposes of 
the Act. Although Mr Alan McLean is a co-trustee and a co-owner/landlord of 
the premises, as Davidson J states in Lothbury Management Ltd v Ryan and 
Anor [2021] NZHC 2621 [1 October 2021] at [45]:
“…where two co-owners agree that the property is to be used by one of them as a 
place of residence, s5(1)(n) applies, and a residential tenancy governed by the Act is 
deemed not to exist”.
7. Whether the Occupants/Tenants are covered by the provisions of the Act, or are 
common law tenants, depends on whether they are family members of the 
Trustee landlord and legal owner of the premises.
Were the occupants/tenants members of the landlord's or owner's family
8. During the hearing, the parties confirmed that Mr Singh is Ms Ram’s sister’s son 
and her nephew. They are therefore related by blood. The parties also 
confirmed that Mrs Zabeen is married to Mr Singh and is therefore related to Ms 
Ram by marriage.
9. Ms Ram, as a co-trustee/landlord/owner, entered into a verbal agreement for Mr 
Singh and his wife to reside at the premises, in exchange for $400 a week for 
the first month and $500 per week thereafter.
10. Ms Ram says she entered into this verbal agreement, on the understanding that 
Mr Singh and Mrs Zabeen are her family members, one by blood and the other 
by marriage. Further, that they were not tenants but occupants that paid rent 
towards offsetting the outgoings of the premises, that Ms Ram has responsibility

premises because s 5(1)(n) of the Act applies.
b There is no residential tenancy, and therefore, no jurisdiction for the 
Tenancy Tribunal to hear this matter.

invoking the s 5 exclusion because:
i Mr Lalit Singh is Ms Ram’s sister’s son, a nephew and 
therefore a blood relative; and
ii Mrs Musarat Zabeen is Mr Lalit Singh’s wife and is therefore 
related to Ms Ram by marriage. 
d Further, Ms Ram made clear to the Occupants/Tenants that there

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - Remote Location
APPLICANT: Inspire Property Management Limited - Ashmith Nand And 
Arishma Lal
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: Natasha Mohr
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: 3B Nield Road, Manurewa, Auckland 2102
ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision. 
2. The tenancy of Natasha Mohr at 3B Nield Road, Manurewa, Auckland 2102 is 
terminated, and possession is granted to Inspire Property Management Limited - 
Ashmith Nand And Arishma Lal, at 11.59 pm on Tuesday 3 October 2023.
3. The landlord’s claim for exemplary damages is dismissed.
4. The landlord’s claim for compensation is adjourned.  A further hearing is to be 
scheduled in person, on the next date and time available, before any Adjudicator. 
Reasons:
1. The hearing was held by teleconference on 6 September 2023.  Both parties 
attended the hearing. 
2. The landlord has applied for termination of the tenancy for breach of the tenant’s 
obligations, exemplary damages and compensation for methamphetamine 
testing and decontamination.
3. Given the urgent nature of the claim and that no in person hearing dates were 
available until November 2023, this matter was scheduled for a remote hearing to consider the claim for termination and exemplary damages only.  The claim for 
compensation is adjourned to another date. 
Should the tenancy be terminated?
4. The Tribunal may terminate a tenancy for breach where, due to the nature or 
extent of the breach, it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate.  See section 
56(1) Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (“the RTA”).
5. Where the breach is capable of remedy the landlord must first serve a notice on 
the tenant requiring them to remedy the breach within at least 14 days and 
establish that the tenant has failed to do so.
6. Where the breach is not capable of remedy, the landlord is not expressly required 
to serve a 14-day breach notice on the tenant.  A breach is not capable to remedy 
where the thing done, or its effect, cannot be undone.  
7. However, unless the breach is serious, the Tribunal usually requires the landlord 
to have warned the tenant about the likely consequences of continued breach 
before it will exercise its discretion to terminate. 
8. The landlord claims the tenant has used the premises unlawfully, by using or 
permitting the smoking of methamphetamine in the premises.
9. A tenant must not use the premises or permit the premises to be used for an 
unlawful purpose. See section 40(2)(b) RTA.
10. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages may 
be awarded up to a maximum of $1,800.00. See section 40(3A)(c) and Schedule 
1A RTA.
11. Tenants are liable for the actions of others who are at the premises with their 
permission. See section 41 RTA.
12. It is unlawful to possess or consume methamphetamine. See section 7(1)(a) and 
Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975.
13. The landlord provided a pre-tenancy methamphetamine test establishing that 
prior to the start of the tenancy, there was no detectable methamphetamine at 
the premises.
14. The landlord provided a further methamphetamine test carried out in August 2023 
which returned positive traces of methamphetamine ranging from 2.94 μg to 
11.60 μg.  Most of the areas tested were at the level of 11.60 μg, other than 
bedrooms 3 and 4. 
15. Based on that evidence, I am satisfied that methamphetamine has been 
consumed in the premises at some point during the tenancy.
16. The breach is not capable of remedy because it is serious and constitutes useof the premises for an unlawful purpose.
17. There is no evidence that methamphetamine has been consumed by the tenant 
herself. She was shocked and upset at what was found. The tenant suggested 
however that she did find out afterwards that someone who had visited or stayed 
at the premises (perhaps a family member) may have done so without her 
knowledge or consent.
18. Methamphetamine can last on surfaces for lengthy periods of time. There is no 
way to determine when methamphetamine was consumed. I can only be satisfied 
that it was consumed at some point during the tenancy.
19. The tenant did not suggest that anyone was in her premises without her 
permission. Based on that, I must infer that whoever has smoked 
methamphetamine was at the premises with her permission. That unfortunately 
means she is liable for their acts even though she may not have known what they 
were doing.
20. I therefore find that the tenant has committed an unlawful act.
21. The seriousness of the unlawful activity in question here is at the upper end of 
the scale and I am satisfied it would be inequitable to refuse to make an order 
terminating the tenancy.
22. I appreciate that the tenant’s personal circumstances are such that moving out 
will be difficult.  However, I cannot consider the impact on the tenant, in making 
an order for termination of the tenancy.
23. Accordingly, the landlord’s application for termination of the tenancy is granted.
24. Given my finding, it is not necessary to address the other ground relied on by the 
landlord for termination.
Should the Tribunal order the tenant to pay exemplary damages?
25.Exemplary damages are designed to punish and deter. They are like a fine. In 
Auckland City Council v Blundell [1986] NZLR 732 the Court of Appeal stated: 
Exemplary and punitive [damages] are different words for the same 
thing. The damages are exemplary because they are meant to teach 
an example to the guilty officer and others. They are punitive 
because they are meant to punish. They are like a fine, though they 
go to the citizen who has been the victim of conduct.
26. Exemplary damages are awarded at the Tribunal’s discretion when one party has 
proved that the other party has committed a defined unlawful act. The Tribunal 
must consider whether it would be just to do so, having regard to the party’s intent, 
the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other party, and the public 
interest. See section 109(3) RTA.27. Intentional means that the party who has committed the breach must be aware 
of it. The focus of the intention however must be the act (or omission) and not the 
legal knowledge of the offending party.
28. In this case, the landlord submitted that whoever had smoked drugs in the 
property must have been connected to the tenant in some way. They therefore 
say there was some element of knowledge on her part. Essentially, the landlord 
is saying that the tenant must have known that person was a drug user and so 
there was a likelihood that drugs were going to be consumed while they were at 
her property.
29. I accept that there may be some basis for such a suspicion on the landlord’s part. 
However, a suspicion is not proof. Bearing in mind that the landlord carries the 
onus and burden of proof, I am not persuaded that it is more likely than not that 
the tenant was aware that methamphetamine had been smoked in her house.
30. I therefore find that the breach was not intentional.
31. Even if I had been persuaded that the breach was intentional, I do not consider it 
would have been just to award exemplary damages in this case. That is because 
exemplary damages are meant to punish a guilty party, and it is difficult to see 
how the tenant’s conduct could be characterised in this way.
31. The claim for exemplary damages is therefore dismissed.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - Remote Location
APPLICANT: Inspire Property Management Limited - Ashmith Nand And 
Arishma Lal
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: Natasha Mohr
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: 3B Nield Road, Manurewa, Auckland 2102
ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision. 
2. The tenancy of Natasha Mohr at 3B Nield Road, Manurewa, Auckland 2102 is 
terminated, and possession is granted to Inspire Property Management Limited - 
Ashmith Nand And Arishma Lal, at 11.59 pm on Tuesday 3 October 2023.
3. The landlord’s claim for exemplary damages is dismissed.
4. The landlord’s claim for compensation is adjourned.  A further hearing is to be 
scheduled in person, on the next date and time available, before any Adjudicator. 
Reasons:
1. The hearing was held by teleconference on 6 September 2023.  Both parties 
attended the hearing. 
2. The landlord has applied for termination of the tenancy for breach of the tenant’s 
obligations, exemplary damages and compensation for methamphetamine 
testing and decontamination.
3. Given the urgent nature of the claim and that no in person hearing dates were 
available until November 2023, this matter was scheduled for a remote hearing to consider the claim for termination and exemplary damages only.  The claim for 
compensation is adjourned to another date. 
Should the tenancy be terminated?
4. The Tribunal may terminate a tenancy for breach where, due to the nature or 
extent of the breach, it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate.  See section 
56(1) Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (“the RTA”).
5. Where the breach is capable of remedy the landlord must first serve a notice on 
the tenant requiring them to remedy the breach within at least 14 days and 
establish that the tenant has failed to do so.
6. Where the breach is not capable of remedy, the landlord is not expressly required 
to serve a 14-day breach notice on the tenant.  A breach is not capable to remedy 
where the thing done, or its effect, cannot be undone.  
7. However, unless the breach is serious, the Tribunal usually requires the landlord 
to have warned the tenant about the likely consequences of continued breach 
before it will exercise its discretion to terminate. 
8. The landlord claims the tenant has used the premises unlawfully, by using or 
permitting the smoking of methamphetamine in the premises.
9. A tenant must not use the premises or permit the premises to be used for an 
unlawful purpose. See section 40(2)(b) RTA.
10. Breaching this obligation is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages may 
be awarded up to a maximum of $1,800.00. See section 40(3A)(c) and Schedule 
1A RTA.
11. Tenants are liable for the actions of others who are at the premises with their 
permission. See section 41 RTA.
12. It is unlawful to possess or consume methamphetamine. See section 7(1)(a) and 
Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975.
13. The landlord provided a pre-tenancy methamphetamine test establishing that 
prior to the start of the tenancy, there was no detectable methamphetamine at 
the premises.
14. The landlord provided a further methamphetamine test carried out in August 2023 
which returned positive traces of methamphetamine ranging from 2.94 μg to 
11.60 μg.  Most of the areas tested were at the level of 11.60 μg, other than 
bedrooms 3 and 4. 
15. Based on that evidence, I am satisfied that methamphetamine has been 
consumed in the premises at some point during the tenancy.
16. The breach is not capable of remedy because it is serious and constitutes useof the premises for an unlawful purpose.
17. There is no evidence that methamphetamine has been consumed by the tenant 
herself. She was shocked and upset at what was found. The tenant suggested 
however that she did find out afterwards that someone who had visited or stayed 
at the premises (perhaps a family member) may have done so without her 
knowledge or consent.
18. Methamphetamine can last on surfaces for lengthy periods of time. There is no 
way to determine when methamphetamine was consumed. I can only be satisfied 
that it was consumed at some point during the tenancy.
19. The tenant did not suggest that anyone was in her premises without her 
permission. Based on that, I must infer that whoever has smoked 
methamphetamine was at the premises with her permission. That unfortunately 
means she is liable for their acts even though she may not have known what they 
were doing.
20. I therefore find that the tenant has committed an unlawful act.
21. The seriousness of the unlawful activity in question here is at the upper end of 
the scale and I am satisfied it would be inequitable to refuse to make an order 
terminating the tenancy.
22. I appreciate that the tenant’s personal circumstances are such that moving out 
will be difficult.  However, I cannot consider the impact on the tenant, in making 
an order for termination of the tenancy.
23. Accordingly, the landlord’s application for termination of the tenancy is granted.
24. Given my finding, it is not necessary to address the other ground relied on by the 
landlord for termination.
Should the Tribunal order the tenant to pay exemplary damages?
25.Exemplary damages are designed to punish and deter. They are like a fine. In 
Auckland City Council v Blundell [1986] NZLR 732 the Court of Appeal stated: 
Exemplary and punitive [damages] are different words for the same 
thing. The damages are exemplary because they are meant to teach 
an example to the guilty officer and others. They are punitive 
because they are meant to punish. They are like a fine, though they 
go to the citizen who has been the victim of conduct.
26. Exemplary damages are awarded at the Tribunal’s discretion when one party has 
proved that the other party has committed a defined unlawful act. The Tribunal 
must consider whether it would be just to do so, having regard to the party’s intent, 
the effect of the unlawful act, the interests of the other party, and the public 
interest. See section 109(3) RTA.27. Intentional means that the party who has committed the breach must be aware 
of it. The focus of the intention however must be the act (or omission) and not the 
legal knowledge of the offending party.
28. In this case, the landlord submitted that whoever had smoked drugs in the 
property must have been connected to the tenant in some way. They therefore 
say there was some element of knowledge on her part. Essentially, the landlord 
is saying that the tenant must have known that person was a drug user and so

APPLICANT: Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: David Albert Alfred Goldsack
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: 137 Selwyn Street, Somerfield, Christchurch 8024
ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply to publication of this decision. 
2. David Albert Alfred Goldsack must by 11.59pm on Wednesday 11 October 2023 
remove the dog “Fatty” from the premises and must not allow the dog back onto 
the premises.
3. David Albert Alfred Goldsack must not keep any dog or other pet on the 
premises without the landlord’s consent.
4. The landlord must deliver a copy of this order to the premises within 24 hours of 
receiving it.
Reasons:
1. Ms Rea attended the hearing by telephone for the landlord. The tenant did not 
attend the hearing.
2. This tenancy began on 23 March 2023. 
3. On 10 July 2023 the landlord became aware that the tenant had a dog on the 
premises. It received a complaint that the dog had injured a person, killed cats 
in the neighbourhood and attacked and injured another dog.4. The landlord tried to contact the tenant and went to the premises, but the tenant 
was not cooperative.
5. The landlord received another complaint about the dog on 18 July and was 
informed that a complaint had been made to Dog Control at Christchurch City 
Council (the Council).
6. The landlord made an OIA request to Dog Control and received evidence that 
the dog, named Fatty, had been classified by the Council as a Dangerous Dog 
under the Dog Control Act 1996.
7. The landlord had a meeting with the tenant on 8 August. The tenant said that he 
hadn’t received the notice of classification from the Council and that he intended 
disputing it.
8. The landlord then issued the tenant with a formal letter declining consent for the 
tenant to keep a dog on the premises and giving him 10 days to remove the 
dog.
9. On 14 August, the Council informed the landlord that the tenant’s application to 
dispute the dangerous dog classification was declined because it was made out 
of time. 
10. On 28 August the tenant informed the landlord that he still had the dog on the 
premises. The landlord believes that the tenant still has the dog on the 
premises.
11. Relevantly, the tenancy agreement states,
You must let us know if you want to keep a pet, including a dog. We will 
allow you to keep pet(s) on the premises as long as the pet(s) meet the 
guidelines explained in the appendix “Can I Keep A Pet”. This forms part of 
this Agreement.
12. The Appendix: Can I Keep A Pet states, relevantly,
If you want to have a pet, including a dog, you need to let us know. We may 
allow you to keep pet(s) at your home as long as:
•The pet is not likely to, or does not, attack any person or other pet and
       If the pet is a dog, as long as:
•The dog is not a specified dangerous or menacing dog under the Dog 
Control Act 1996 and
13. These provisions are unconventional. Typically, a tenancy agreement will 
expressly prohibit pets on the premises without the landlord’s written consent. 
This agreement does not do that. The only express term requires the tenant to 
tell the landlord if they want to have pet on the premises. The tenant has not 
done that, certainly not before he brought the dog onto the premises.14. Proving a breach of that obligation does not get the landlord very far. It does not 
follow from that breach that the tenant must not have a dog or other pet on the 
premises. 
15. By its application, the landlord plainly wants the Tribunal to infer from the terms 
of the agreement that the tenant must not have a dog or other pet on the 
premises without the landlord’s consent. That is not ideal. It is not clear to me 
why the landlord has not simply prohibited pets without its consent or at least 
made it clearer that it will allow pets in certain circumstances but otherwise they 
are prohibited.
16. That said, taking paragraph 19 of the agreement and the corresponding 
appendix together, I find that a reasonable tenant reading the agreement would 
understand that they were required to inform the landlord if they wanted to have 
a pet on the premises and that if any the requirements in the Appendix were not 
met, and the landlord did not give its consent for the pet, they were not 
permitted to have it on the premises.
17. In this case the requirements for having the dog on the premises have not been 
met and the landlord has refused to give consent for the dog to be on the 
premises. The tenant must not, therefore, have the dog on the premises.
18. The landlord has applied for an order requiring the tenant to remove the dog 
from the premises. After discussion with Ms Rea during the hearing, she agreed 
that the order should also require the tenant to keep the dog and any other pets 
that the landlord has not consented to, off the premises. Ms Rea proposed 14 
days to comply with the order to remove the dog. I have therefore made such 
an order.
19. Because the Tribunal does not have an email address for the tenant for service, 
I have directed the landlord to deliver a copy of this order to the premises within 
24 hours of receiving it.

2. David Albert Alfred Goldsack must by 11.59pm on Wednesday 11 October 2023 
remove the dog “Fatty” from the premises and must not allow the dog back onto 
the premises.
3. David Albert Alfred Goldsack must not keep any dog or other pet on the 
premises without the landlord’s consent.
4. The landlord must deliver a copy of this order to the premises within 24 hours of 
receiving it.
Reasons:
1. Ms Rea attended the hearing by telephone for the landlord. The tenant did not 
attend the hearing.
2. This tenancy began on 23 March 2023. 
3. On 10 July 2023 the landlord became aware that the tenant had a dog on the 
premises. It received a complaint that the dog had injured a person, killed cats 
in the neighbourhood and attacked and injured another dog.4. The landlord tried to contact the tenant and went to the premises, but the tenant 
was not cooperative.
5. The landlord received another complaint about the dog on 18 July and was 
informed that a complaint had been made to Dog Control at Christchurch City 
Council (the Council).
6. The landlord made an OIA request to Dog Control and received evidence that 
the dog, named Fatty, had been classified by the Council as a Dangerous Dog 
under the Dog Control Act 1996.
7. The landlord had a meeting with the tenant on 8 August. The tenant said that he 
hadn’t received the notice of classification from the Council and that he intended 
disputing it.
8. The landlord then issued the tenant with a formal letter declining consent for the 
tenant to keep a dog on the premises and giving him 10 days to remove the 
dog.
9. On 14 August, the Council informed the landlord that the tenant’s application to 
dispute the dangerous dog classification was declined because it was made out 
of time. 
10. On 28 August the tenant informed the landlord that he still had the dog on the 
premises. The landlord believes that the tenant still has the dog on the 
premises.
11. Relevantly, the tenancy agreement states,
You must let us know if you want to keep a pet, including a dog. We will 
allow you to keep pet(s) on the premises as long as the pet(s) meet the 
guidelines explained in the appendix “Can I Keep A Pet”. This forms part of 
this Agreement.
12. The Appendix: Can I Keep A Pet states, relevantly,
If you want to have a pet, including a dog, you need to let us know. We may 
allow you to keep pet(s) at your home as long as:
•The pet is not likely to, or does not, attack any person or other pet and
       If the pet is a dog, as long as:
•The dog is not a specified dangerous or menacing dog under the Dog 
Control Act 1996 and
13. These provisions are unconventional. Typically, a tenancy agreement will 
expressly prohibit pets on the premises without the landlord’s written consent. 
This agreement does not do that. The only express term requires the tenant to 
tell the landlord if they want to have pet on the premises. The tenant has not 
done that, certainly not before he brought the dog onto the premises.14. Proving a breach of that obligation does not get the landlord very far. It does not 
follow from that breach that the tenant must not have a dog or other pet on the 
premises. 
15. By its application, the landlord plainly wants the Tribunal to infer from the terms 
of the agreement that the tenant must not have a dog or other pet on the 
premises without the landlord’s consent. That is not ideal. It is not clear to me 
why the landlord has not simply prohibited pets without its consent or at least 
made it clearer that it will allow pets in certain circumstances but otherwise they 
are prohibited.
16. That said, taking paragraph 19 of the agreement and the corresponding 
appendix together, I find that a reasonable tenant reading the agreement would 
understand that they were required to inform the landlord if they wanted to have 
a pet on the premises and that if any the requirements in the Appendix were not 
met, and the landlord did not give its consent for the pet, they were not 
permitted to have it on the premises.
17. In this case the requirements for having the dog on the premises have not been 
met and the landlord has refused to give consent for the dog to be on the 
premises. The tenant must not, therefore, have the dog on the premises.
18. The landlord has applied for an order requiring the tenant to remove the dog 
from the premises. After discussion with Ms Rea during the hearing, she agreed 
that the order should also require the tenant to keep the dog and any other pets 
that the landlord has not consented to, off the premises. Ms Rea proposed 14 
days to comply with the order to remove the dog. I have therefore made such 
an order.
19. Because the Tribunal does not have an email address for the tenant for service, 
I have directed the landlord to deliver a copy of this order to the premises within 
24 hours of receiving it.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - Waitakere | Waitākere
APPLICANT: Peresitene Akelise
 Tenant
RESPONDENT: Shelter Realty Limited trading as Harcourts New Lynn as 
agent for Gordon Deane
 Landlord
TENANCY ADDRESS: Unit/Flat 3, 42 Brandon Road, Glen Eden, Auckland 0602
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case by both parties. No 
suppression orders are made.
2. Shelter Realty Limited trading as Harcourts New Lynn as agent for Gordon 
Deane must pay Peresitene Akelise $900.00 immediately, being compensation 
for the loss of enjoyment of the tenancy due to a leaking pipe that caused 
dampness and damage to the floor in parts of the premises. 
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing. Mr Singh and Ms Ahluwalia represented the 
landlord.
2. The tenant has applied for a full refund of rent as compensation for the loss of 
enjoyment and use of the premises due to dampness and moisture that 
compromised areas of flooring and caused mould in the living room. The tenant 
also alleges that there was no source of heating at the premises.Background
3. The tenancy started on 10 December 2021. It was a fixed term tenancy to 8 
December 2022.
4. During the tenancy various repair issues arose. The main issue was dampness 
that affected the floors in the bathroom/shower, toilet, and 1 adjoining bedroom.
5. The tenant says there was no source of heating and in winter the premises 
were cold.
6. The tenants contacted government agencies for assistance. The were placed in 
emergency accommodation and they had to move several times before being 
offered a Kāinga-Ora house where they now reside.
7. When the landlord had the dampness issue assessed, a leaking pipe under the 
house was discovered. That was the cause of the dampness in the floors in the 
affected rooms (the floors were sealed plywood). Contractor unavailability 
meant that the leak could not be repaired immediately. 
8. The landlord offered the tenant other places to view but the tenant did not 
consider them within his rental price range.
9. The tenancy ended on 11 July 2022. The landlord agreed to release the tenant 
from the fixed term tenancy.
10. On 24 April 2023 the tenant made the application that is before the Tribunal 
today. He sought compensation in the form of a full refund of rent paid 
($18,000.00) for what he alleged was the landlord’s failure to provide and 
maintain the premises in a reasonable state of repair.
11. The tenant did not attend the first scheduled hearing. The application was 
dismissed. However, the adjudicator who was to hear the application granted 
the tenant a rehearing.
Issues
12. The issues before the Tribunal are these:
•Did the landlord fail to provide and maintain the premises in a reasonable 
state of repair?
•If so, should the Tribunal award the tenant compensation?
Did the landlord fail to provide and maintain the premises in a reasonable 
state of repair?
13. The tenant alleges that the premises had no form of heating.14. The landlord produced evidence (pre and post tenancy inspections reports) that 
show there was a heat pump in the lounge.
15. When I put that to the tenant, he said the unit was an air conditioner.
16. A heat pump has two distinct functions – heating and cooling. I suspect that the 
tenant did not know that the unit was a heat pump as well as an air conditioner.
17. I find that the premises did have a source of heating (the previously existing 
fireplace having been blocked up as required by the Healthy Homes Standards 
(HHS)).
18. There was no breach by the landlord failing to provide a source of heating. 
Therefore, the fact that the tenants chose to sleep in their car with the heating 
on during the coldest nights was not a consequence of any landlord breach.
19. Nor is the presence of a small area of mould in the living room in front of the 
closed off fireplace.
20. The landlord accepted that there was a leaking pipe under the floor of the 
premises that affected the plywood flooring in the bathroom/shower, toilet and 1 
adjacent bedroom.
21. The tenant said that all the floors in the premises were affected, but there is 
insufficient evidence for me to find that was the case. 
22. Due to contractor unavailability, the landlord could not have the leaking pipe 
repaired and the leaking continued for the last three months at least of the 
tenancy.
23. While the leaking was probably present before then the landlord did not have it 
assessed. 
24. The tenant said he told his then property manager about the dampness issue in 
the bathroom and was promised it would be repaired. He said no-one came to 
fix it.
25. The landlord produced evidence that its contractors found it difficult to contact 
the tenant.
26. The landlord said they were first advised about the leaking on 30 March 2023 
and the contractors assessed the problem on 1,4 and 6 April 2023.
27. Regardless of the conflict in the evidence, it is clear that there was a leaking 
issue that made the plywood flooring damp and spongy, something that needed 
to be repaired but was not. This affected the tenant’s enjoyment of the tenancy.
28. The tenant also claimed that the kitchen tap was faulty and would not turn off.
29. The landlord said they were informed of the tap issue in February 2022 and the 
repair was done on 17 February. Evidence of the repair (the invoice) was 
produced in evidence. The taps were replaced.30.  Overall, the pre and post inspection reports, including photos, do not show that 
the premises were in the state of disrepair alleged by the tenant.
31. However, I accept that there would have been some loss of enjoyment of the 
tenancy due to the dampness that resulted from the leaking pipe under the 
house, and this restricted the use of part of the premises. 
32. Had the tenant realised that there was a heat pump at the premises not just an 
air conditioner, some of that loss of enjoyment would have been reduced.
Should the Tribunal award the tenant compensation?
33. The Tribunal may award compensation to a tenant for losses arising from a 
proven breach or breaches by the landlord of their statutory responsibilities. 
34. Compensation is generally awarded for actual losses and sometimes for less 
tangible effects of proven breaches such as a loss of enjoyment of the tenancy 
and the accompanying stress and anxiety. 
35. The tenant’s compensation claim is for the loss of use of and therefore 
enjoyment of the tenancy.
36. In Birch v Otautahi Community Housing Trust [2020] NZDC 17667 the District 
Court confirmed that the Tribunal must consider the following factors when 
deciding to award compensation:
•The nature of the breach;
•The duration of the breach; and
•The effect of the breach on the party.
37. The tenant seeks a full refund of rent. That claim is unrealistic. Rent can only 
abate when the premises are destroyed or so seriously damaged (in whole or in 
part) so as to become uninhabitable. That was not the case here.
38. The tenant cannot be compensated for his belief that there was no heat pump. 
The evidence shows that there was a heat pump. The landlord committed no 
breach.
39. The tenant did experience a loss of enjoyment of the tenancy due to dampness 
that affected the flooring in the bathroom/shower, toilet, and 1 adjacent 
bedroom.
40. That loss of enjoyment was not due to a landlord breach as such; it was due to 
a burst pipe. But the repair work could not be done quickly, and it is probable 
that the problem was present from early on in the tenancy.
41. Compensation is not punitive. It simply recognises that the tenant has suffered 
a loss of enjoyment in this case due to a necessary repair issue that was 
delayed.42. The landlord agreed to release the tenant from the fixed term tenancy but that 
too causes disruption and stress for a tenant; rental properties are in demand 
especially in the price range the tenant could afford. So, the landlord’s offer 
does not detract from the loss of enjoyment the tenant experienced.
43. For this loss of enjoyment, I award the tenant compensation of $900.00 
reflecting the principles set out in Birch mentioned above.
Result
44. The landlord will pay the tenant compensation of $900.00 for his loss of 
enjoyment of the tenancy due to dampness issues and the delayed repair of the 
burst pipe that caused the dampness.
45. I make no order reimbursing the filing fee. The tenant’s application is only 
marginally successful.
Name suppression
46. Both parties sought a name suppression order.
47. I make no orders for name suppression. The tenant’s application is only 
successful in small part. The landlord has not fully defended the application, an 
order having been made against it – see section 95A Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.

38. The tenant cannot be compensated for his belief that there was no heat pump. 
The evidence shows that there was a heat pump. The landlord committed no 
breach.

does not detract from the loss of enjoyment the tenant experienced.
43. For this loss of enjoyment, I award the tenant compensation of $900.00 
reflecting the principles set out in Birch mentioned above.
Result
44. The landlord will pay the tenant compensation of $900.00 for his loss of 
enjoyment of the tenancy due to dampness issues and the delayed repair of the 
burst pipe that caused the dampness.
45. I make no order reimbursing the filing fee. The tenant’s application is only 
marginally successful.
Name suppression
46. Both parties sought a name suppression order.
47. I make no orders for name suppression. The tenant’s application is only 
successful in small part. The landlord has not fully defended the application, an 
order having been made against it – see section 95A Residential Tenancies Act

12. The issues before the Tribunal are these:
•Did the landlord fail to provide and maintain the premises in a reasonable 
state of repair?
•If so, should the Tribunal award the tenant compensation?
Did the landlord fail to provide and maintain the premises in a reasonable 
state of repair?
13. The tenant alleges that the premises had no form of heating.14. The landlord produced evidence (pre and post tenancy inspections reports) that 
show there was a heat pump in the lounge.
15. When I put that to the tenant, he said the unit was an air conditioner.
16. A heat pump has two distinct functions – heating and cooling. I suspect that the 
tenant did not know that the unit was a heat pump as well as an air conditioner.
17. I find that the premises did have a source of heating (the previously existing 
fireplace having been blocked up as required by the Healthy Homes Standards 
(HHS)).
18. There was no breach by the landlord failing to provide a source of heating. 
Therefore, the fact that the tenants chose to sleep in their car with the heating 
on during the coldest nights was not a consequence of any landlord breach.
19. Nor is the presence of a small area of mould in the living room in front of the 
closed off fireplace.
20. The landlord accepted that there was a leaking pipe under the floor of the 
premises that affected the plywood flooring in the bathroom/shower, toilet and 1 
adjacent bedroom.
21. The tenant said that all the floors in the premises were affected, but there is 
insufficient evidence for me to find that was the case. 
22. Due to contractor unavailability, the landlord could not have the leaking pipe 
repaired and the leaking continued for the last three months at least of the 
tenancy.
23. While the leaking was probably present before then the landlord did not have it 
assessed. 
24. The tenant said he told his then property manager about the dampness issue in 
the bathroom and was promised it would be repaired. He said no-one came to 
fix it.
25. The landlord produced evidence that its contractors found it difficult to contact 
the tenant.
26. The landlord said they were first advised about the leaking on 30 March 2023 
and the contractors assessed the problem on 1,4 and 6 April 2023.
27. Regardless of the conflict in the evidence, it is clear that there was a leaking 
issue that made the plywood flooring damp and spongy, something that needed 
to be repaired but was not. This affected the tenant’s enjoyment of the tenancy.
28. The tenant also claimed that the kitchen tap was faulty and would not turn off.
29. The landlord said they were informed of the tap issue in February 2022 and the 
repair was done on 17 February. Evidence of the repair (the invoice) was 
produced in evidence. The taps were replaced.30.  Overall, the pre and post inspection reports, including photos, do not show that 
the premises were in the state of disrepair alleged by the tenant.
31. However, I accept that there would have been some loss of enjoyment of the 
tenancy due to the dampness that resulted from the leaking pipe under the 
house, and this restricted the use of part of the premises. 
32. Had the tenant realised that there was a heat pump at the premises not just an 
air conditioner, some of that loss of enjoyment would have been reduced.
Should the Tribunal award the tenant compensation?
33. The Tribunal may award compensation to a tenant for losses arising from a 
proven breach or breaches by the landlord of their statutory responsibilities. 
34. Compensation is generally awarded for actual losses and sometimes for less 
tangible effects of proven breaches such as a loss of enjoyment of the tenancy 
and the accompanying stress and anxiety. 
35. The tenant’s compensation claim is for the loss of use of and therefore 
enjoyment of the tenancy.
36. In Birch v Otautahi Community Housing Trust [2020] NZDC 17667 the District 
Court confirmed that the Tribunal must consider the following factors when 
deciding to award compensation:
•The nature of the breach;
•The duration of the breach; and
•The effect of the breach on the party.
37. The tenant seeks a full refund of rent. That claim is unrealistic. Rent can only 
abate when the premises are destroyed or so seriously damaged (in whole or in 
part) so as to become uninhabitable. That was not the case here.
38. The tenant cannot be compensated for his belief that there was no heat pump. 
The evidence shows that there was a heat pump. The landlord committed no 
breach.
39. The tenant did experience a loss of enjoyment of the tenancy due to dampness 
that affected the flooring in the bathroom/shower, toilet, and 1 adjacent 
bedroom.
40. That loss of enjoyment was not due to a landlord breach as such; it was due to 
a burst pipe. But the repair work could not be done quickly, and it is probable 
that the problem was present from early on in the tenancy.
41. Compensation is not punitive. It simply recognises that the tenant has suffered 
a loss of enjoyment in this case due to a necessary repair issue that was 
delayed.42. The landlord agreed to release the tenant from the fixed term tenancy but that 
too causes disruption and stress for a tenant; rental properties are in demand 
especially in the price range the tenant could afford. So, the landlord’s offer 
does not detract from the loss of enjoyment the tenant experienced.
43. For this loss of enjoyment, I award the tenant compensation of $900.00 
reflecting the principles set out in Birch mentioned above.
Result
44. The landlord will pay the tenant compensation of $900.00 for his loss of 
enjoyment of the tenancy due to dampness issues and the delayed repair of the 
burst pipe that caused the dampness.
45. I make no order reimbursing the filing fee. The tenant’s application is only 
marginally successful.
Name suppression
46. Both parties sought a name suppression order.
47. I make no orders for name suppression. The tenant’s application is only 
successful in small part. The landlord has not fully defended the application, an 
order having been made against it – see section 95A Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.

APPLICANT: Property Brokers Manawatu Limited As Agent For K Kishore
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: Toua Samuelu, Patricia Samuelu
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: 9 Domain Street, Palmerston North, Palmerston North 4410
ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision. 
2. Toua Samuelu and Patricia Samuelu must pay Property Brokers Manawatu 
Limited As Agent For K Kishore $470.44 immediately, as calculated in the table 
below:
Description Landlord Tenant
Rent arrears to 27 September 2023 $450.00  
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44  
Total award $470.44  
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $470.44  
Reasons:
1. The hearing was held by teleconference. The agent for the landlord attended 
the hearing.  The other party did not attend.  The tenants were contacted 
several times on the contact numbers provided in the application but on all 
occasions the call went straight to voicemail. 
2. The landlord has applied for rent arrears and has provided rent records which 
prove the amount owing.3. The landlord sought, in addition to an order for the rent arrears, that I make an 
order for termination.  However, the original application did not include a claim 
for termination of the tenancy and termination was not referred to on the original 
notice of hearing sent to the tenants (see section 91(2)(a) Residential 
Tenancies Act 1986).  As the tenants have not been properly notified that their 
tenancy was at risk of a termination order today, I am unable to make a 
termination order. 
4. Having said this, the Tribunal sounds a note of caution to the tenants. It is 
hazardous to persistently have outstanding rent arrears. It is time-consuming 
and hence costly for the landlord to pursue this debt. A persistent pattern of rent 
arrears may well result in the Tribunal taking the view that it would be 
inequitable for the Tribunal to refuse to terminate the tenancy.
5. As the landlord has been wholly successful with the application, I must order the 
other party to reimburse the filing fee.

TENANCY ADDRESS: Unit/Flat 3, 44 Stanley Point Road, Stanley Point, Auckland

ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision. 
2. The application is dismissed.
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.  The tenant was represented by Choon Wee 
Ang.
2. The tenant has applied for a claim relating to the Healthy Homes standards.
3. The claim concerns the flooding event in Auckland on 27 January 2023.  The 
downstairs of the tenancy flooded.  The tenant is seeking compensation 
equivalent to one week’s rent of $695.00 due to the damage caused by the 
flood.
4. The tenant refers to the drainage on the premises and states in her application 
that the landlord had covered the drainage with planter boxes.  This is denied 
by the landlord who says that subsequent to the flooding she has not been able 
to locate a stormwater drain for the premises.5. At the hearing the landlord produced a Certificate of Compliance dated 4 
August 2022 which states that the tenancy complies with regulation 27 of the 
Healthy Homes standards in that it has an effective drainage system.
6. This certificate is evidence that the landlord had complied with her obligation in 
relation to the Healthy Homes standards as it relates to drainage.  What 
transpired was that either the drainage was not effective due to the heavy 
rainfall, or the flooding of the premises had been exacerbated by other factors 
such as the neighbour’s swimming pool overflowing.
7. After the flooding the landlord arranged for a contractor to commence the clean 
up within 24 hours of the flooding.  The landlord had offered the tenant alternate 
accommodation which was not accepted and instead she stayed elsewhere.  
That accommodation required considerable travel to the tenant’s place of 
employ.
8. I acknowledge that there was some inconvenience to the tenant as there was to 
all tenants and landlords who were impacted by the flooding.  But the question I 
must consider is whether the landlord was in breach of the Healthy Homes 
standards and if so, whether the tenant should be compensated.
9. Given the Certificate of Compliance I consider that the landlord has not 
breached the Healthy Homes standards.  Also, it became apparent during the 
hearing that the landlord had already offered rent relief equivalent to 11 days 
rent totalling $1092.00 as well as a reduction in the utility costs.  That offer had 
been accepted.
10. I do not consider that the tenant is entitled to any further compensation.  In the 
circumstances the landlord acted reasonably.
11. The tenant’s claim is dismissed.

calculated as shown in table below:
Description Landlord Tenant
Break Lease fee $850.00  
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44  
Total award $870.44  
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $870.44  
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended this remote teleconference hearing on 27 September 
2023.
2. The parties entered into a tenancy agreement in February 2023.
 3. The tenancy was to have commenced on 1 April 2023.
4. Having signed the tenancy agreement on 17 February 2023, the tenant says 
that she contacted the landlord the next day to let the landlord know that she 
had changed her mind about the tenancy and no longer wished to proceed 
with the tenancy. As a matter of law, the tenant is not entitled to simply cancel 
the agreement because they have changed their mind.
5. The landlord says that they agreed to the surrender of the lease on the basis 
that the tenant paid the costs associated with reletting the premises. The 
landlord said that reletting was difficult and that it took three weeks to find new 
tenants. The landlord said that no rent was received for that three week 
period,  but that they had not sought payment from the tenant for that amount.
6. Where a tenant surrenders a tenancy and the landlord consents to the 
surrender, the landlord is entitled to recover from the tenant “any expenses 
reasonably incurred by the landlord in respect of the termination”s.44A(1) 
Residential Tenancy Act 1986. 
7. The landlord seeks $862.36 for time, travel, advertising, credit and background 
checks, attending viewings and administration time. The landlord explained 
that these were actual costs incurred in obtaining new tenants and not a 
standard fee.
8. The tenant submitted that the landlord would have incurred this cost anyway at 
the end of the fixed term tenancy and that no costs had been incurred by the 
landlord in in finding her as a tenant. However, this is not a certainty. A 
landlord can sometimes re-let the premises without the need for advertising 
and other related costs. That was not the situation here .
9. The landlord does not need to rely upon the tenancy agreement to seek 
payment, or partial payment, of this type of cost in a break-lease scenario. The 
cost is recoverable on a compensation basis. The argument is that if it weren’t 
for the break lease, the landlord would not have incurred this cost until the end 
of the tenancy, and therefore the landlord has incurred an “additional” cost as 
a result of the early termination. 10.I accept that the sum claimed by the landlord was a direct and necessary 
consequence of ending the tenancy before the expiry of the fixed term. The 
sum claimed is not unreasonable.
11.As Jean Marilyn Bewick has wholly succeeded with the claim I must order the 
tenant to reimburse the filing fee.
12.The tenant applied for name suppression. The tenant has not been wholly or 
substantially successful in this matter and the application is dismissed.

landlord said that reletting was difficult and that it took three weeks to find new 
tenants. The landlord said that no rent was received for that three week 
period,  but that they had not sought payment from the tenant for that amount.
6. Where a tenant surrenders a tenancy and the landlord consents to the 
surrender, the landlord is entitled to recover from the tenant “any expenses 
reasonably incurred by the landlord in respect of the termination”s.44A(1) 
Residential Tenancy Act 1986. 
7. The landlord seeks $862.36 for time, travel, advertising, credit and background 
checks, attending viewings and administration time. The landlord explained 
that these were actual costs incurred in obtaining new tenants and not a 
standard fee.
8. The tenant submitted that the landlord would have incurred this cost anyway at 
the end of the fixed term tenancy and that no costs had been incurred by the 
landlord in in finding her as a tenant. However, this is not a certainty. A 
landlord can sometimes re-let the premises without the need for advertising 
and other related costs. That was not the situation here .
9. The landlord does not need to rely upon the tenancy agreement to seek 
payment, or partial payment, of this type of cost in a break-lease scenario. The 
cost is recoverable on a compensation basis. The argument is that if it weren’t 
for the break lease, the landlord would not have incurred this cost until the end 
of the tenancy, and therefore the landlord has incurred an “additional” cost as 
a result of the early termination. 10.I accept that the sum claimed by the landlord was a direct and necessary 
consequence of ending the tenancy before the expiry of the fixed term. The 
sum claimed is not unreasonable.
11.As Jean Marilyn Bewick has wholly succeeded with the claim I must order the 
tenant to reimburse the filing fee.
12.The tenant applied for name suppression. The tenant has not been wholly or 
substantially successful in this matter and the application is dismissed.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - [Event location suppressed]
APPLICANT: [The applicant/s]
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: Allie Mitchell, Camilo Aristizabal Gomez, Karl Fesenmeier, 
Max Farmer, Merlyn Manson, Sarah MacDonald, Tom 
McDermott, Gerry McKeown, Maeve Cudmore, Nathan 
Taylor, Zak Cohen Rudin, Eva Sweet-Anderson
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: [Tenancy address suppressed]
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal 
orders suppression of the Landlord name and identifying details.
2. By way of declaration the landlord is entitled to show the premises to prospective 
tenants at any reasonable time after giving the tenants 48 hours notice. 
3. Allie Mitchell, Camilo Aristizabal Gomez, Karl Fesenmeier, Max Farmer, Merlyn 
Manson, Sarah MacDonald, Tom McDermott, Gerry McKeown, Maeve Cudmore, 
Nathan Taylor, Zak Cohen Rudin, Eva Sweet-Anderson must pay the landlord 
the filing fee of $20.44 immediately
4. The application by the tenants for a declaration and exemplary damages is 
dismissed.
Reasons:
1. Two of the tenants and the landlord attended the hearing.2. The tenants seek a declaration that the landlord is unable to hold viewings for the 
premises for prospective tenants and exemplary damages for breach of quiet 
enjoyment.
3. The landlord has cross applied for a declaration allowing viewings for prospective 
tenants.
4. The tenancy is for a fixed term from 1/1/2023 to 31/12/2023 at $1,920.00 rent per 
week.
Has the landlord breached the tenants’ quiet enjoyment?
5. The tenants claim the landlord has breached their quiet enjoyment of the 
premises by showing prospective tenants around the property, without consent 
on 23/8/2023.
6. The tenants submitted that since 25 July they had made it clear to the previous 
landlord that the property was not available for viewing by prospective tenants 
because they had not made up their mind whether they would be staying in the 
premises after the end of the fixed term.
7. Further the tenants said they were advised via email on 21 August that the 
landlord would be showing family members around the premises with a view to 
them becoming tenants in 2024.
8. Based on the fact that the landlord undertook the viewing two days after the email 
and the difficulties which had arisen with repairs and maintenance during the 
tenancy the tenants believed the landlord had committed an unlawful act and 
wanted exemplary damages. 
9. In response the landlord submitted that because she did not receive any 
response to her email of 21 August, she believed she had the consent of the 
tenants for the viewing.
10. Further because the three tenants who were at the premises on 23 August did 
not object to the viewing the landlord went ahead with showing the premises to 
her son.
11. A landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace, comfort or privacy of the 
tenant in their use of the premises.  See section 38(2) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
12. Breaching this obligation in circumstances that amount to harassment is an 
unlawful act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of 
$3,000.00.  See section 38(3) and Schedule 1A RTA.
13. I find the landlord has not breached the tenants’ quiet enjoyment in their use of 
the premises by showing prospective tenants the premises and certainly not in 
circumstances that amount to harassment.14. This is a fixed term tenancy. It is one to which section 60A, as amended in 2021, 
applies. The effect of section 60A(1) is to continue a fixed term tenancy as a 
periodic tenancy unless any of the circumstances specified in section 60A(2) or 
(3) applies. 
15. The amendment only applies to tenancies granted after 11 February 2021. This 
is the case here as the tenancy began on 1 January 2023. 
16. Subsection 60A(2) provides that the tenancy does not continue as a periodic 
tenancy if: 
a. Before the expiry, the parties renew or extend the existing tenancy 
agreement; or 
b. Before the expiry, the parties agree not to continue with the tenancy; or 
c. At least 28 days before the expiry, the tenant gives the landlord written notice 
of the tenant’s intention not to continue with the tenancy; or 
d. Before the expiry a party gives notice in relation to physical assault, unlawful 
residential premises, mortgagees entitled to possession, destruction of 
premises, where a breach renders premises uninhabitable and maximum 
level of contaminant, none which are applicable in this case.
17. Although the tenants have not yet given the landlord any notice about whether 
they are continuing with the tenancy, and have until 3 December to do so, this 
does not mean that the landlord cannot show prospective tenants the premises.
18. Under section 60A landlords and tenants have rights about how a fixed term 
tenancy may end.
19. The renting of premises is a business and the landlord suggested because of the 
size of the property finding new tenants could be difficult, as had happened at the 
beginning of 2023.
20. I consider the evidence supports that the landlord is attempting to ensure the 
continuation of her business as far as the legislation allows her to do so.
21. However, the landlord needs to be careful of signing up any new tenancy 
agreement for 2024 when there is an existing tenancy still in place, be that fixed 
term or periodic.
22. Harassment means ""to trouble, worry or distress"" or ""to wear out, tire, or exhaust"" 
and ""indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person"".  
MacDonald v Dodds, CIV-2009-019-001524, DC Hamilton, 26 February 2010.
23. Black’s Law Dictionary defines harassment as:
Words, conduct, or action (usu. repeated or persistent) that, being directed at 
a specific person, annoys, alarms, or causes substantial emotional distress in 
that person and serves no legitimate purpose.24. These definitions suggest there must be evidence of some ongoing intentional 
actions directed at a specific person which causes distress to them. Therefore, a 
single act of interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment would be unlikely to 
amount to harassment, unless it was an occasion of significant seriousness, 
which I do not consider is the case here. 
25. As the landlord has not committed an unlawful act, the claim for exemplary 
damages fails. 
Did the landlord enter without consent and did the tenants unreasonably withhold 
consent?
26. [The landlord/s] claims the tenant has not allowed her entry to the premises when 
she was entitled to enter.
27. The day after the viewing on 21 August the landlord submitted that she received 
an email from the tenants suggesting that she had entered the premises without 
consent, and they did not agree to the premises being shown to prospective 
tenants.
28. The landlord said she sent a 14 day notice to the tenants dated 28 August 2023 
advising them she believed their refusal to allow viewings was a breach.
29. On the other hand, the tenants believed it was unreasonable for the landlord to 
schedule viewings because they had not told the landlord whether or not they 
were leaving the tenancy at the end of the fixed term. 
30. A landlord may enter the premises during the tenancy at any reasonable time 
with the tenant's consent, for the purpose of showing the premises to, among 
others, prospective tenants.  See section 48(3)(a) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.
31. Under subsection (3A) a tenant may not withhold consent unreasonably and a 
landlord may not enter without prior consent.
32. Breaching these respective obligations is an unlawful act for which exemplary 
damages may be awarded up to a maximum of $1,500.00.  See section 48 
(4)(a)&(b) and Schedule 1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
33. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 20, 21 and 22, I find the tenants have 
committed an unlawful act by unreasonably refusing to allow viewings of the 
premises by prospective tenants.
34. The reason given by the tenants that there should be no viewings because they 
haven’t yet told the landlord whether they are leaving is I consider not a 
reasonable excuse.35. The landlord has indicated that the prospective tenants she has in mind, who are 
the friends of her sons, need to be shown through within the next four weeks, 
before the end of the University year.
36. Based on the evidence of the landlord I do not consider this is unreasonable.
37. As the landlord did not ask for exemplary damages for the breach by the tenants, 
I do not need to consider that issue.
38. I find the landlord did have consent to enter the premises on 23 August.
39. When the tenants received the 48 hours notice about the viewing they did not 
respond to the landlord.
40. The evidence of the landlord supports that the three tenants at the premises at 
the time of the viewing did not object, and this evidence was not disputed by the 
tenants.
41. I have ordered by way of declaration that the landlord is entitled to show 
prospective tenants the premises pursuant to section 48(3)(a).
42. The tenants’ application for a declaration fails.
43. As [The applicant/s] has wholly succeeded with the claim I must award the filing 
fee.
44. Suppression is granted to the landlord pursuant to section 95A because she was 
successful with the claim.
45. No filing fee or suppression is available to the tenants.

12. Breaching this obligation in circumstances that amount to harassment is an 
unlawful act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of

13. I find the landlord has not breached the tenants’ quiet enjoyment in their use of 
the premises by showing prospective tenants the premises and certainly not in 
circumstances that amount to harassment.14. This is a fixed term tenancy. It is one to which section 60A, as amended in 2021, 
applies. The effect of section 60A(1) is to continue a fixed term tenancy as a 
periodic tenancy unless any of the circumstances specified in section 60A(2) or 
(3) applies. 
15. The amendment only applies to tenancies granted after 11 February 2021. This 
is the case here as the tenancy began on 1 January 2023. 
16. Subsection 60A(2) provides that the tenancy does not continue as a periodic 
tenancy if: 
a. Before the expiry, the parties renew or extend the existing tenancy 
agreement; or 
b. Before the expiry, the parties agree not to continue with the tenancy; or

d. Before the expiry a party gives notice in relation to physical assault, unlawful 
residential premises, mortgagees entitled to possession, destruction of

17. Although the tenants have not yet given the landlord any notice about whether 
they are continuing with the tenancy, and have until 3 December to do so, this 
does not mean that the landlord cannot show prospective tenants the premises.

tenancy may end.
19. The renting of premises is a business and the landlord suggested because of the

which I do not consider is the case here. 
25. As the landlord has not committed an unlawful act, the claim for exemplary 
damages fails. 
Did the landlord enter without consent and did the tenants unreasonably withhold 
consent?
26. [The landlord/s] claims the tenant has not allowed her entry to the premises when 
she was entitled to enter.
27. The day after the viewing on 21 August the landlord submitted that she received 
an email from the tenants suggesting that she had entered the premises without

28. The landlord said she sent a 14 day notice to the tenants dated 28 August 2023

29. On the other hand, the tenants believed it was unreasonable for the landlord to 
schedule viewings because they had not told the landlord whether or not they 
were leaving the tenancy at the end of the fixed term. 
30. A landlord may enter the premises during the tenancy at any reasonable time 
with the tenant's consent, for the purpose of showing the premises to, among 
others, prospective tenants.  See section 48(3)(a) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.
31. Under subsection (3A) a tenant may not withhold consent unreasonably and a 
landlord may not enter without prior consent.
32. Breaching these respective obligations is an unlawful act for which exemplary 
damages may be awarded up to a maximum of $1,500.00.  See section 48 
(4)(a)&(b) and Schedule 1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
33. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 20, 21 and 22, I find the tenants have 
committed an unlawful act by unreasonably refusing to allow viewings of the 
premises by prospective tenants.
34. The reason given by the tenants that there should be no viewings because they 
haven’t yet told the landlord whether they are leaving is I consider not a 
reasonable excuse.35. The landlord has indicated that the prospective tenants she has in mind, who are 
the friends of her sons, need to be shown through within the next four weeks,

I do not need to consider that issue.
38. I find the landlord did have consent to enter the premises on 23 August.
39. When the tenants received the 48 hours notice about the viewing they did not 
respond to the landlord.
40. The evidence of the landlord supports that the three tenants at the premises at

tenants at any reasonable time after giving the tenants 48 hours notice. 
3. Allie Mitchell, Camilo Aristizabal Gomez, Karl Fesenmeier, Max Farmer, Merlyn 
Manson, Sarah MacDonald, Tom McDermott, Gerry McKeown, Maeve Cudmore, 
Nathan Taylor, Zak Cohen Rudin, Eva Sweet-Anderson must pay the landlord 
the filing fee of $20.44 immediately
4. The application by the tenants for a declaration and exemplary damages is 
dismissed.
Reasons:
1. Two of the tenants and the landlord attended the hearing.2. The tenants seek a declaration that the landlord is unable to hold viewings for the 
premises for prospective tenants and exemplary damages for breach of quiet 
enjoyment.
3. The landlord has cross applied for a declaration allowing viewings for prospective 
tenants.
4. The tenancy is for a fixed term from 1/1/2023 to 31/12/2023 at $1,920.00 rent per 
week.
Has the landlord breached the tenants’ quiet enjoyment?
5. The tenants claim the landlord has breached their quiet enjoyment of the 
premises by showing prospective tenants around the property, without consent 
on 23/8/2023.
6. The tenants submitted that since 25 July they had made it clear to the previous 
landlord that the property was not available for viewing by prospective tenants 
because they had not made up their mind whether they would be staying in the 
premises after the end of the fixed term.
7. Further the tenants said they were advised via email on 21 August that the 
landlord would be showing family members around the premises with a view to 
them becoming tenants in 2024.
8. Based on the fact that the landlord undertook the viewing two days after the email 
and the difficulties which had arisen with repairs and maintenance during the 
tenancy the tenants believed the landlord had committed an unlawful act and 
wanted exemplary damages. 
9. In response the landlord submitted that because she did not receive any 
response to her email of 21 August, she believed she had the consent of the 
tenants for the viewing.
10. Further because the three tenants who were at the premises on 23 August did 
not object to the viewing the landlord went ahead with showing the premises to 
her son.
11. A landlord must not interfere with the reasonable peace, comfort or privacy of the 
tenant in their use of the premises.  See section 38(2) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. 
12. Breaching this obligation in circumstances that amount to harassment is an 
unlawful act for which exemplary damages may be awarded up to a maximum of 
$3,000.00.  See section 38(3) and Schedule 1A RTA.
13. I find the landlord has not breached the tenants’ quiet enjoyment in their use of 
the premises by showing prospective tenants the premises and certainly not in 
circumstances that amount to harassment.14. This is a fixed term tenancy. It is one to which section 60A, as amended in 2021, 
applies. The effect of section 60A(1) is to continue a fixed term tenancy as a 
periodic tenancy unless any of the circumstances specified in section 60A(2) or 
(3) applies. 
15. The amendment only applies to tenancies granted after 11 February 2021. This 
is the case here as the tenancy began on 1 January 2023. 
16. Subsection 60A(2) provides that the tenancy does not continue as a periodic 
tenancy if: 
a. Before the expiry, the parties renew or extend the existing tenancy 
agreement; or 
b. Before the expiry, the parties agree not to continue with the tenancy; or 
c. At least 28 days before the expiry, the tenant gives the landlord written notice 
of the tenant’s intention not to continue with the tenancy; or 
d. Before the expiry a party gives notice in relation to physical assault, unlawful 
residential premises, mortgagees entitled to possession, destruction of 
premises, where a breach renders premises uninhabitable and maximum 
level of contaminant, none which are applicable in this case.
17. Although the tenants have not yet given the landlord any notice about whether 
they are continuing with the tenancy, and have until 3 December to do so, this 
does not mean that the landlord cannot show prospective tenants the premises.
18. Under section 60A landlords and tenants have rights about how a fixed term 
tenancy may end.
19. The renting of premises is a business and the landlord suggested because of the 
size of the property finding new tenants could be difficult, as had happened at the 
beginning of 2023.
20. I consider the evidence supports that the landlord is attempting to ensure the 
continuation of her business as far as the legislation allows her to do so.
21. However, the landlord needs to be careful of signing up any new tenancy 
agreement for 2024 when there is an existing tenancy still in place, be that fixed 
term or periodic.
22. Harassment means ""to trouble, worry or distress"" or ""to wear out, tire, or exhaust"" 
and ""indicates a particular pattern of behaviour directed towards another person"".  
MacDonald v Dodds, CIV-2009-019-001524, DC Hamilton, 26 February 2010.
23. Black’s Law Dictionary defines harassment as:
Words, conduct, or action (usu. repeated or persistent) that, being directed at 
a specific person, annoys, alarms, or causes substantial emotional distress in 
that person and serves no legitimate purpose.24. These definitions suggest there must be evidence of some ongoing intentional 
actions directed at a specific person which causes distress to them. Therefore, a 
single act of interference with the tenant’s quiet enjoyment would be unlikely to 
amount to harassment, unless it was an occasion of significant seriousness, 
which I do not consider is the case here. 
25. As the landlord has not committed an unlawful act, the claim for exemplary 
damages fails. 
Did the landlord enter without consent and did the tenants unreasonably withhold 
consent?
26. [The landlord/s] claims the tenant has not allowed her entry to the premises when 
she was entitled to enter.
27. The day after the viewing on 21 August the landlord submitted that she received 
an email from the tenants suggesting that she had entered the premises without 
consent, and they did not agree to the premises being shown to prospective 
tenants.
28. The landlord said she sent a 14 day notice to the tenants dated 28 August 2023 
advising them she believed their refusal to allow viewings was a breach.
29. On the other hand, the tenants believed it was unreasonable for the landlord to 
schedule viewings because they had not told the landlord whether or not they 
were leaving the tenancy at the end of the fixed term. 
30. A landlord may enter the premises during the tenancy at any reasonable time 
with the tenant's consent, for the purpose of showing the premises to, among 
others, prospective tenants.  See section 48(3)(a) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.
31. Under subsection (3A) a tenant may not withhold consent unreasonably and a 
landlord may not enter without prior consent.
32. Breaching these respective obligations is an unlawful act for which exemplary 
damages may be awarded up to a maximum of $1,500.00.  See section 48 
(4)(a)&(b) and Schedule 1A Residential Tenancies Act 1986.
33. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 20, 21 and 22, I find the tenants have 
committed an unlawful act by unreasonably refusing to allow viewings of the 
premises by prospective tenants.
34. The reason given by the tenants that there should be no viewings because they 
haven’t yet told the landlord whether they are leaving is I consider not a 
reasonable excuse.35. The landlord has indicated that the prospective tenants she has in mind, who are 
the friends of her sons, need to be shown through within the next four weeks, 
before the end of the University year.
36. Based on the evidence of the landlord I do not consider this is unreasonable.
37. As the landlord did not ask for exemplary damages for the breach by the tenants, 
I do not need to consider that issue.
38. I find the landlord did have consent to enter the premises on 23 August.
39. When the tenants received the 48 hours notice about the viewing they did not 
respond to the landlord.
40. The evidence of the landlord supports that the three tenants at the premises at 
the time of the viewing did not object, and this evidence was not disputed by the 
tenants.
41. I have ordered by way of declaration that the landlord is entitled to show 
prospective tenants the premises pursuant to section 48(3)(a).
42. The tenants’ application for a declaration fails.
43. As [The applicant/s] has wholly succeeded with the claim I must award the filing 
fee.
44. Suppression is granted to the landlord pursuant to section 95A because she was 
successful with the claim.
45. No filing fee or suppression is available to the tenants.

Filing fee reimbursement $20.44  
Total award $3,945.75  
Bond $1,440.00  Reasons:
1. Only the applicant landlord attended the hearing.
2. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, compensation, refund of the bond, 
and reimbursement of the filing fee following the end of the tenancy.
How much is owed for rent?
3. The tenancy ended on 11 May 2023.  The landlord provided rent records which 
prove the amount owing at the end of the tenancy.
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
4. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all 
chattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential 
Tenancies Act 1986.  The tenant is required to replace worn out smoke alarm 
batteries during the tenancy.  See section 40(1)(ca) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.  The tenant must also replace standard light bulbs.
5. The tenant did not leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not 
remove all rubbish. The lawns and gardens were overgrown and an arear of 
lawn required replanting.
6. The tenant did not return the keys. 
7. The amounts ordered are proved.
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
8. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
9. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord's 
insurance, the tenant's liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or 
four weeks' rent (or four weeks' market rent in the case of a tenant paying 
income-related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  
10. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, 
the tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent).  See section 49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the 
tenant's conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the 
damage.  See section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.
11. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
12. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
13. The following damage was caused during the tenancy: several walls and doors 
were damaged, a window had been repaired but with glass that did not fit and 
the clothesline which was less than a year old was damaged. The damage is 
more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved liability for the 
damage.
14. The amounts ordered are proved.
15. I have taken into account betterment and depreciation.  The landlord should be 
returned to the position they would have been in had the tenant not breached 
their obligations, and should not be better or worse off.  In calculating 
depreciation, I have taken into account the age and condition of the items at the 
start of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan.   The claim for replacement 
doors is reduced because there is an element of fair wear and tear with the door 
hardware. The claim for repairing walls is only for repairs and not painting, it is 
allowed in full.
16. Because Monarch Realty Limited T/A Harcourts Property Management As 
Agent For Trevor Roberts has wholly succeeded with the claim I must 
reimburse the filing fee.

Reasons:
1. The landlord attended the hearing. The tenant did not appear.
2. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, compensation, exemplary damages, 
refund of the bond, and reimbursement of the filing fee following the end of the 
tenancy.
How much is owed for rent and water rates?
3. The tenancy ended on 7 July 2023. The landlord provided rent records and water 
rates invoices which prove the amount owing at the end of the tenancy. 
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
4. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean and 
tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all chattels 
provided for their benefit. See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential Tenancies Act 
1986. The tenant is required to replace worn out smoke alarm batteries during the 
tenancy. See section 40(1)(ca) Residential Tenancies Act 1986. The tenant must 
also replace standard light bulbs.
5. The tenant did not leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not 
remove a significant amount of rubbish. The premises required extensive cleaning 
to bring it up to a reasonable standard. 
6. The tenant did not return the keys or garage remotes. 
7. The following chattels were missing at the end of the tenancy: plugs from 
bathrooms and insinkerator stopper. The landlord also had to replace light bulbs. 
8. The amounts ordered are proved. I have reduced the amount claimed for cleaning 
to $25.00 per hour for the work done by the owners for a total amount of $1550.00 
for 31 hours (2 people). I find the time spent was reasonable given the filthy state 
the premises was left in. Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
9. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage. Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission. See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
10. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord's 
insurance, the tenant's liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or 
four weeks' rent (or four weeks' market rent in the case of a tenant paying income-
related rent). See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  
11. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, the 
tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent). See section 49B(3)(b) 
RTA. Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the tenant's conduct, the 
property is treated as if it is not insured against the damage. See section 
49B(3A)(a) RTA.
12. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence. This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for. See section 49B(1) RTA.
13. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose. Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage is a 
certainty. See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
14. The landlord withdrew claims relating to the benchtop and floorboards totalling 
$13,443.85. 
15. I find that the following intentional and extensive damage was caused during the 
tenancy: multiple holes in walls throughout the premises, smashed doors, carpet 
damaged by extensive staining and faeces throughout, garage carpet damaged by 
extensive oil stains, broken insinkerator, dishwasher door damaged, ceilings 
damaged, blinds broken, broken shower trap, broken window in lounge; and 
multiple electrical repairs due to damaged heat pump and rangehood, oven floor, 
light fitting in bedroom, and extractor fan in bathroom. 
16. The damage is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved 
liability for the damage. 
17. The amounts ordered are proved. The landlord claimed $549.00 for a new 
dishwasher. However, I have reduced this by 50% to reflect likely repair costs as I 
am not persuaded a new machine was required when the door could have been 
fixed/replaced. 
18. I have taken into account betterment and depreciation in relation to the paintwork 
and carpets. The landlord should be returned to the position they would have been 
in had the tenant not breached their obligations, and should not be better or worse ","[2023] NZTT 4664979

11. In support of the claim the landlord provided entry and inspection reports, with 
photographs and invoices.
12. In response the tenants disputed that the carpets needed cleaning at the end of 
the tenancy.
13. I am satisfied from the evidence that the tenants did not leave the premises 
reasonably clean and tidy, and the bedroom carpets required cleaning.
14. Awards have been made for carpet cleaning and 10 hours cleaning of the 
kitchen and bathroom.
Are the tenants responsible for the damage to the premises?
15. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA. 
16. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord's 
insurance, the tenant's liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or 
four weeks' rent (or four weeks' market rent in the case of a tenant paying 
income-related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  
17. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, 
the tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent).  See section 
49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the 
tenant's conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the 
damage.  See section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.
18. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
19. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
20. Due to the extent and type of damage the landlord believed the damage was 
intentional.
21. Moreover, the landlord is unable to obtain insurance for the premises.
22. Based on the invoices from the builder who undertook the work, which included 
the costs of the electrical and gib stopping contractors the landlord sought 
compensation of $21,990.47.
23. Further the landlord claimed $575.00 for replacement of the dishwasher and 
$4,440.00 loss of rent for the time taken to complete the work on the premises.
24. During the hearing the landlord reduced the claim for loss of rent to two weeks 
because the time taken included work on another flat in the same complex. 
25. The builder who undertook the work appeared and gave evidence about the 
extensive damage to walls, doors, the heat pump, dishwasher and flooring in 
the kitchen/lounge. 
26. The witness also explained his invoices and suggested that all the work 
undertaken on the premises was not charged for, in particular the damage to 
the external wall in October.
27. I am persuaded by the evidence provided, including the witness and 
photographs that significant damage was caused to the premises during the 
tenancy. This included holes in walls and doors, the heat pump removed from the wall, the dishwasher was damaged and flooring in the kitchen/lounge had to 
be replaced.  
28. The damage is more than fair wear and tear. 
29. Although the tenants did not dispute most of the damage, they were unhappy 
with the amount being claimed.
30. In making an award I have taken into account betterment and depreciation.
31. The landlord should be returned to the position they would have been in had the 
tenants not breached their obligations and should not be better or worse off.  
32. In calculating depreciation, I have considered the age and condition of the items 
at the start of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan and the 
acknowledgement of both the landlord and witness that the premises had been 
remedied to a higher standard, using more industrial materials, than previously.
33. As Propertyscouts Dunedin 2017 Limited As Agent For T Barnes has wholly 
succeeded with the claim I must award the filing fee.

Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: 18A Fairs Road, Milson, Palmerston North 4414
ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision. 
2. Samuel Smits must pay Fordyce Realty Limited As Agent For Ashleigh Lowe 
$1,913.50 immediately, calculated as shown in table below.
Description Landlord
Rent arrears to 26/8/2023 after bond refunded $165.71
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44
Repairs: front door $207.00
Repairs: other including rubbish removal $664.90
Break lease fee $555.45
Gate replacement $300.00
Total award $1,913.50
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $1,913.50
Reasons:
1. The landlord attended the hearing represented by Mr Fordyce. The tenant did 
not attend.2. The tenancy commenced on 9 April 2023 for a fixed term of one year but was 
ended early at the tenant’s request. The premises were retenanted from 27 
August 2023. 
3. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, compensation, and reimbursement of 
the filing fee following the end of the tenancy.
How much is owed for rent ?
4. When a fixed term tenancy is broken, the tenant is liable for rent to the date the 
premises were retenanted..  The landlord provided rent records of the rent due 
to 26 August 2023. The bond has been refunded leaving arrears of $165.71 
owing. 
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
5. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all 
chattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential 
Tenancies Act 1986
6. The tenant did not remove all rubbish.
7. The amounts ordered are proved.
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
8. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
9. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord's 
insurance, the tenant's liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or 
four weeks' rent (or four weeks' market rent in the case of a tenant paying 
income-related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  
10. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, 
the tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent).  See section 
49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the 
tenant's conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the 
damage.  See section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.
11. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.12. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
13. The following damage was caused during the tenancy:
•Damage to the back and front doors from dog scratches. These required filing 
and repainting;
•The curtains in one room were covered in mould and had to replaced. These 
were new at the beginning of the tenancy;
•There was blue paint on some of the decking and two large gouges one two 
decking boards. These boards have been replaced and the paint removed;
•The were deep gouges on one of the bedroom walls that required repair;
•The large wire gate had been badly dented on one side and cannot be repaired. 
It cannot be opened easily. The Landlord claimed $648.60 for a replacement 
gate, however photographs showed that the gate was far from new and showed 
signs of rust. I have taken into account depreciation and awarded $300.00 as a 
contribution towards replacement. 
•The landlord claimed for 2 replacement lavender bushes that he believed had 
been damaged by a dog. The photographs showed that while there was some 
damage the plants were alive and with trimming back would regrow. I have 
deducted $40.00 from the claim.  
14. While I find the damage was not intentional I do find it can be regarded as 
careless and more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved 
liability for the damage.
15. The amounts ordered are proved.
Can expenses on lease break be awarded?
16.Where the landlord agrees to an early termination of lease they are entitled to 
claim any reasonable expenses incurred in this process, including retenanting, 
provided an itemised account I presented. See s.44A RTA
17.The landlord did present an itemised account of reasonable expenses and that 
claim is successful. 18. Because Fordyce Realty Limited As Agent For Ashleigh Lowe has substantially 
succeeded with the claim I have reimbursed the filing fee.

chattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential 
Tenancies Act 1986
6. The tenant did not remove all rubbish.
7. The amounts ordered are proved.
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
8. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
9. Where the damage is caused carelessly, and is covered by the landlord's 
insurance, the tenant's liability is limited to the lesser of the insurance excess or 
four weeks' rent (or four weeks' market rent in the case of a tenant paying 
income-related rent).  See section 49B(3)(a) RTA.  
10. Where the damage is careless and is not covered by the landlord's insurance, 
the tenant's liability is limited to four weeks' rent (or market rent).  See section 
49B(3)(b) RTA.  Where insurance money is irrecoverable because of the 
tenant's conduct, the property is treated as if it is not insured against the 
damage.  See section 49B(3A)(a) RTA.
11. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.12. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
13. The following damage was caused during the tenancy:
•Damage to the back and front doors from dog scratches. These required filing 
and repainting;
•The curtains in one room were covered in mould and had to replaced. These 
were new at the beginning of the tenancy;
•There was blue paint on some of the decking and two large gouges one two 
decking boards. These boards have been replaced and the paint removed;
•The were deep gouges on one of the bedroom walls that required repair;
•The large wire gate had been badly dented on one side and cannot be repaired. 
It cannot be opened easily. The Landlord claimed $648.60 for a replacement 
gate, however photographs showed that the gate was far from new and showed 
signs of rust. I have taken into account depreciation and awarded $300.00 as a 
contribution towards replacement. 
•The landlord claimed for 2 replacement lavender bushes that he believed had 
been damaged by a dog. The photographs showed that while there was some 
damage the plants were alive and with trimming back would regrow. I have 
deducted $40.00 from the claim.  
14. While I find the damage was not intentional I do find it can be regarded as 
careless and more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved 
liability for the damage.
15. The amounts ordered are proved.
Can expenses on lease break be awarded?
16.Where the landlord agrees to an early termination of lease they are entitled to 
claim any reasonable expenses incurred in this process, including retenanting, 
provided an itemised account I presented. See s.44A RTA
17.The landlord did present an itemised account of reasonable expenses and that 
claim is successful. 18. Because Fordyce Realty Limited As Agent For Ashleigh Lowe has substantially 
succeeded with the claim I have reimbursed the filing fee.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - Palmerston North | Te Papaioea
APPLICANT: Hawick Qian
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: Folole Hana Fiso
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: 652 Pioneer Highway, Highbury, Palmerston North 4412
ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision.
2. Folole Hana Fiso must pay Hawick Qian $1,571.81 immediately, calculated as 
shown in table below.
Description Landlord Tenant
Rent arrears $857.14  
Cleaning $400.00  
Rubbish removal $1,854.23  
Repairs $360.00  
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44  
Total award $3,491.81  
Bond $1,920.00  
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $1,571.81  
Reasons:
1. On 10 August 2023 I adjourned the landlord’s application for rent arrears, 
compensation, refund of the bond, and reimbursement of the filing fee following 
the end of the tenancy to allow the landlord to provide proper evidence to 
substantiate his claims. 2. Today he was represented by his colleague, Bernadine Wastney, from Manner 
Property Management. Although he had advised the Tribunal before the hearing 
that Ms Wastney would be attending, he did not apply to have a representative 
appointed. Ms Wastney confirmed that Mr Qian is the owner and landlord of this 
property. He should have attended himself or applied for the Tribunal to allow 
representation. I allowed Ms Wastney to attend on Mr Qian’s behalf.
3. The tenant did not appear. Ms Wastney advised that the tenant had needed to 
leave the property at short notice and was very apologetic that she had not 
been able to attend to matters properly and she had signed over the bond to Mr 
Qian.
4. Mr Qian has now provided a proper rent summary. The amount sought is 
slightly more than in the original application but the rent summary makes it clear 
that it is owing. The tenant had not been in arrears until the end when she did 
not pay the last week and a bit. The amount of $857 owing to the date of 
termination on 24 March 2023 is proved.
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
5. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy and remove all rubbish.  See section 40(1)(e) Residential Tenancies 
Act 1986.  
6. The landlord provided photos which showed that the tenant did not leave the 
premises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not remove all rubbish. Ms 
Wastney had helped the landlord clean and tidy the property and she confirmed 
that the tenant had not undertaken any cleaning.
7. The landlord submitted an invoice #2300132 dated 23 March from Feng Qian 
J&J Maintenance Service to Feng Qian1 for rubbish dispose for “Enviro waste”. 
This is the day before the rent was owed to. The quantity is 1 and the rate is 
shown as $1,004.23. The labour is again, quantity 1 and the amount is $850. 
There is no breakdown of hours, hourly rate and no GST. The landlord should 
provide receipts and itemised accounts. However, I have decided the amount is 
reasonable and have ordered the Tribunal to pay this.
8. There is a second invoice #2300148 dated 24 March for $1,355.00 for cleaning. 
The quantity is again 1. The rate is $1,355. Again there is no hourly rate or 
number of hours. I have allowed $400.00 for cleaning the property which is a 
reasonable amount and in keeping with other claims before the Tribunal. Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
9. The landlord has other claims for damage/repairs to the property. A landlord 
must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy and is 
more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the tenant 
must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the damage.  
Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
10. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
11. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
12. The landlord provided a photograph showing a damaged tiles in the bathroom 
and an itemised invoice dated 9 April 2021 from Odd Job Bob for replacing the 
shower platform. The landlord also provided an email dated 16 May 2021 from 
the tenant asking if she can start making payments for the repairs in the 
bathroom. I am satisfied that the damage occurred during the tenancy and it is 
more than fair wear and tear. I order the tenant to pay $360.88.
13. There is a third invoice #2300134, also dated 23 March 2023 from Feng Qian 
J&J maintenance service. It lists a number of items totalling $1,493.92. The 
items listed are living room roll curtain replacement, shower door, repair, 
bedroom wall paper damage, shower sink blockage, bedroom carpet 
replacement, towel rack broken, door handle, drawer handle. It is unclear 
whether the figures listed are disbursements or time spent. With the exception 
of the claim for carpet, there are no invoices or receipts.
14. The landlord has not provided entry photos or an entry report. The exit report is 
blank apart from the entry of “N” for “No” in the “undamaged” column for Lounge 
Room and “N” for “No” in the “undamaged” column for the following items:
Staircases/railings, Wheelie and recycle bins Pool/equipment. Street 
number/letter box, External walls, Balcony/porch/deck, Awning/gutters,  
Paving/pergola, Garage/car port/ storeroom, Garden shed, Gates/fences,  
Grounds/garden, External taps/hose, Clothes line, Solar panels,  
Paths/driveway, Other.  
15. This simply does not make sense. For example, there is no evidence of a pool 
or solar panels in the photographs provided.
16. The landlord was provided with an opportunity to properly substantiate his 
claims and has not done so. Although there is an invoice for replacement of bedroom carpet, there is no photo of the damaged carpet, description of it in the 
exit report, no explanation of the damage, no information about the age of the 
carpet. 
17. All of the claims in the invoice number #2300134 are dismissed.

reimbursed the filing fee.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - Palmerston North | Te Papaioea
APPLICANT: Hawick Qian
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: Folole Hana Fiso
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: 652 Pioneer Highway, Highbury, Palmerston North 4412
ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision.
2. Folole Hana Fiso must pay Hawick Qian $1,571.81 immediately, calculated as 
shown in table below.
Description Landlord Tenant
Rent arrears $857.14  
Cleaning $400.00  
Rubbish removal $1,854.23  
Repairs $360.00  
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44  
Total award $3,491.81  
Bond $1,920.00  
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $1,571.81  
Reasons:
1. On 10 August 2023 I adjourned the landlord’s application for rent arrears, 
compensation, refund of the bond, and reimbursement of the filing fee following 
the end of the tenancy to allow the landlord to provide proper evidence to 
substantiate his claims. 2. Today he was represented by his colleague, Bernadine Wastney, from Manner 
Property Management. Although he had advised the Tribunal before the hearing 
that Ms Wastney would be attending, he did not apply to have a representative 
appointed. Ms Wastney confirmed that Mr Qian is the owner and landlord of this 
property. He should have attended himself or applied for the Tribunal to allow 
representation. I allowed Ms Wastney to attend on Mr Qian’s behalf.
3. The tenant did not appear. Ms Wastney advised that the tenant had needed to 
leave the property at short notice and was very apologetic that she had not 
been able to attend to matters properly and she had signed over the bond to Mr 
Qian.
4. Mr Qian has now provided a proper rent summary. The amount sought is 
slightly more than in the original application but the rent summary makes it clear 
that it is owing. The tenant had not been in arrears until the end when she did 
not pay the last week and a bit. The amount of $857 owing to the date of 
termination on 24 March 2023 is proved.
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
5. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy and remove all rubbish.  See section 40(1)(e) Residential Tenancies 
Act 1986.  
6. The landlord provided photos which showed that the tenant did not leave the 
premises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not remove all rubbish. Ms 
Wastney had helped the landlord clean and tidy the property and she confirmed 
that the tenant had not undertaken any cleaning.
7. The landlord submitted an invoice #2300132 dated 23 March from Feng Qian 
J&J Maintenance Service to Feng Qian1 for rubbish dispose for “Enviro waste”. 
This is the day before the rent was owed to. The quantity is 1 and the rate is 
shown as $1,004.23. The labour is again, quantity 1 and the amount is $850. 
There is no breakdown of hours, hourly rate and no GST. The landlord should 
provide receipts and itemised accounts. However, I have decided the amount is 
reasonable and have ordered the Tribunal to pay this.
8. There is a second invoice #2300148 dated 24 March for $1,355.00 for cleaning. 
The quantity is again 1. The rate is $1,355. Again there is no hourly rate or 
number of hours. I have allowed $400.00 for cleaning the property which is a 
reasonable amount and in keeping with other claims before the Tribunal. Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
9. The landlord has other claims for damage/repairs to the property. A landlord 
must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy and is 
more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the tenant 
must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the damage.  
Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
10. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
11. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
12. The landlord provided a photograph showing a damaged tiles in the bathroom 
and an itemised invoice dated 9 April 2021 from Odd Job Bob for replacing the 
shower platform. The landlord also provided an email dated 16 May 2021 from 
the tenant asking if she can start making payments for the repairs in the 
bathroom. I am satisfied that the damage occurred during the tenancy and it is 
more than fair wear and tear. I order the tenant to pay $360.88.
13. There is a third invoice #2300134, also dated 23 March 2023 from Feng Qian 
J&J maintenance service. It lists a number of items totalling $1,493.92. The 
items listed are living room roll curtain replacement, shower door, repair, 
bedroom wall paper damage, shower sink blockage, bedroom carpet 
replacement, towel rack broken, door handle, drawer handle. It is unclear 
whether the figures listed are disbursements or time spent. With the exception 
of the claim for carpet, there are no invoices or receipts.
14. The landlord has not provided entry photos or an entry report. The exit report is 
blank apart from the entry of “N” for “No” in the “undamaged” column for Lounge 
Room and “N” for “No” in the “undamaged” column for the following items:
Staircases/railings, Wheelie and recycle bins Pool/equipment. Street 
number/letter box, External walls, Balcony/porch/deck, Awning/gutters,  
Paving/pergola, Garage/car port/ storeroom, Garden shed, Gates/fences,  
Grounds/garden, External taps/hose, Clothes line, Solar panels,  
Paths/driveway, Other.  
15. This simply does not make sense. For example, there is no evidence of a pool 
or solar panels in the photographs provided.
16. The landlord was provided with an opportunity to properly substantiate his 
claims and has not done so. Although there is an invoice for replacement of bedroom carpet, there is no photo of the damaged carpet, description of it in the 
exit report, no explanation of the damage, no information about the age of the 
carpet. 
17. All of the claims in the invoice number #2300134 are dismissed.

water refund (amount paid by tenant included in rent)  $3,280.00
Total award $11,663.23 $3,280.00
Net award $8,383.23  
Bond $2,900.00  
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $5,483.23  Reasons:
1. The agent Ms Bhatt attended the hearing for the landlord. There was no 
appearance by the tenants.
2. This tenancy was a fixed term tenancy from 21 June 2022 to 26 June 2023. The 
tenants moved out on 15 May 2023. 
3. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, electricity owing, compensation for 
unblocking drain, cleaning, carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, repairs to window 
and walls, rubbish removal and reimbursement of the filing fee following the end 
of the tenancy.
4. The bond of $2900.00 was refunded recently by consent.
How much is owed for rent and electricity?
5. The landlord provided rent records which prove the amount owing at the end of 
the tenancy. From 11 April to 15 May 2023, there was $1,812.50 owing which 
included water. From 16 May to 2 June 2023, there was $1,684.26 owing which 
excluded water.
6. The landlord accepts there is a credit owing to the tenant for water usage. The 
agent has calculated that actual water usage throughout the tenancy was 
$988.49. The tenant paid $3,280 during the tenancy ($70 per week) as it was 
included in the rent amount.
7. The landlord also received the electricity bills in their name. This was passed to 
the tenants regularly for payment. The tenants have not paid $563.50 electricity 
that is remaining.
8. The amounts sought have been clarified by the agent, confirmation there was 
no double charges, and to the benefit of the tenant.
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
9. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy (including lawn/garden) and remove all rubbish.  See section 
40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential Tenancies Act 1986.  
10. The tenant did not leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not 
remove all rubbish.
11. The agent said the premises had seemed to have been abandoned and not 
been cleaned and tidied and provided photos. The tenant said they would 
remove their rubbish and belongings but this did not occur despite 
arrangements being made. Ultimately the tenant was not contactable, and the 
items had to be removed.12. The amounts ordered for cleaning, carpet cleaning, lawn tidy and rubbish 
removal are proved.
13. The landlord claims compensation for unblocking of the toilet drain.
14. It would appear that there was a lot of toilet paper blocking a drain which was 
on the outside the house. It is concerning that this wastewater drain is open to 
the elements. 
15. Considering the claim, if there had been other items in the drain, it would be of 
concern about how the toilet is being used. It is usual to find toilet paper in a 
waste system. I am not satisfied this was caused by the tenant through ordinary 
use of a toilet. This claim is dismissed.
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
16. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
17. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
18. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
19. The following damage was caused during the tenancy: damage to 2 windows, 
walls in the 3 bedrooms, lounge and passageway. The agent showed pictures 
of a number of holes on the walls, glue on the master bedroom, strong marks 
on the walls. 
20. The pre-inspection photos show an older tidy house. 
21. The agent says 2 windows had to be repaired and provided an invoice, photos 
pre-inspection and post inspection. The amount of $334.88 is awarded for this 
repair.
22. The agent says the walls and ceiling had been repainted before this tenant 
moved in. The doors, frames and skirting were aged and not painted. These 
appear to have been of a lower standard. 23. The photos showing the damage to the walls in the bedrooms, lounge and 
passage way is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved 
liability for the damage.
24. The agent proved the Tribunal with 2 quotes they had been provided to repair 
the damage. The agent also provided an invoice which included an entire 
repaint of the house. Considering the information and after hearing from the 
agent provided, the Tribunal awards $4500.00 towards the repairs. 
25. I have taken into account betterment and depreciation.  The landlord should be 
returned to the position they would have been in had the tenant not breached 
their obligations, and should not be better or worse off.  In calculating 
depreciation, I have taken into account the age and condition of the items at the 
start of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan.   
26. Because Rentout Limited As Agent For Lakshmi Narayanan Srinivasan has 
substantially succeeded with the claim I have reimbursed the filing fee.
27. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision.

and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
17. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
18. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
19. The following damage was caused during the tenancy: damage to 2 windows, 
walls in the 3 bedrooms, lounge and passageway. The agent showed pictures 
of a number of holes on the walls, glue on the master bedroom, strong marks 
on the walls. 
20. The pre-inspection photos show an older tidy house. 
21. The agent says 2 windows had to be repaired and provided an invoice, photos 
pre-inspection and post inspection. The amount of $334.88 is awarded for this 
repair.
22. The agent says the walls and ceiling had been repainted before this tenant 
moved in. The doors, frames and skirting were aged and not painted. These 
appear to have been of a lower standard. 23. The photos showing the damage to the walls in the bedrooms, lounge and 
passage way is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved 
liability for the damage.
24. The agent proved the Tribunal with 2 quotes they had been provided to repair 
the damage. The agent also provided an invoice which included an entire 
repaint of the house. Considering the information and after hearing from the 
agent provided, the Tribunal awards $4500.00 towards the repairs. 
25. I have taken into account betterment and depreciation.  The landlord should be 
returned to the position they would have been in had the tenant not breached 
their obligations, and should not be better or worse off.  In calculating 
depreciation, I have taken into account the age and condition of the items at the 
start of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan.   
26. Because Rentout Limited As Agent For Lakshmi Narayanan Srinivasan has 
substantially succeeded with the claim I have reimbursed the filing fee.
27. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision.

TENANCY ADDRESS: 83 Christmas Road, Manurewa, Auckland 2102
ORDER
1. Tukuahi Bernadette Stephenia Mahara and Lynne Amy Thompson must pay 
Rentout Limited As Agent For Lakshmi Narayanan Srinivasan $5,483.23 
immediately, calculated as shown in table below.
Description Landlord Tenant
Rent arrears to 2 June 2023 $3,496.76  
Electricity $526.38  
Cleaning $563.50  
Carpet Cleaning $272.78  
Lawns and Garden work $200.00  
Rubbish removal $760.00  
Repairs: windows x2 $334.88  
Repairs: bedrooms, lounge and passage $4,500.00  
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44  
Water rates: actual usage owing $988.49  
water refund (amount paid by tenant included in rent)  $3,280.00
Total award $11,663.23 $3,280.00
Net award $8,383.23  
Bond $2,900.00  
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $5,483.23  Reasons:
1. The agent Ms Bhatt attended the hearing for the landlord. There was no 
appearance by the tenants.
2. This tenancy was a fixed term tenancy from 21 June 2022 to 26 June 2023. The 
tenants moved out on 15 May 2023. 
3. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, electricity owing, compensation for 
unblocking drain, cleaning, carpet cleaning, lawn mowing, repairs to window 
and walls, rubbish removal and reimbursement of the filing fee following the end 
of the tenancy.
4. The bond of $2900.00 was refunded recently by consent.
How much is owed for rent and electricity?
5. The landlord provided rent records which prove the amount owing at the end of 
the tenancy. From 11 April to 15 May 2023, there was $1,812.50 owing which 
included water. From 16 May to 2 June 2023, there was $1,684.26 owing which 
excluded water.
6. The landlord accepts there is a credit owing to the tenant for water usage. The 
agent has calculated that actual water usage throughout the tenancy was 
$988.49. The tenant paid $3,280 during the tenancy ($70 per week) as it was 
included in the rent amount.
7. The landlord also received the electricity bills in their name. This was passed to 
the tenants regularly for payment. The tenants have not paid $563.50 electricity 
that is remaining.
8. The amounts sought have been clarified by the agent, confirmation there was 
no double charges, and to the benefit of the tenant.
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
9. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy (including lawn/garden) and remove all rubbish.  See section 
40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential Tenancies Act 1986.  
10. The tenant did not leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy, and did not 
remove all rubbish.
11. The agent said the premises had seemed to have been abandoned and not 
been cleaned and tidied and provided photos. The tenant said they would 
remove their rubbish and belongings but this did not occur despite 
arrangements being made. Ultimately the tenant was not contactable, and the 
items had to be removed.12. The amounts ordered for cleaning, carpet cleaning, lawn tidy and rubbish 
removal are proved.
13. The landlord claims compensation for unblocking of the toilet drain.
14. It would appear that there was a lot of toilet paper blocking a drain which was 
on the outside the house. It is concerning that this wastewater drain is open to 
the elements. 
15. Considering the claim, if there had been other items in the drain, it would be of 
concern about how the toilet is being used. It is usual to find toilet paper in a 
waste system. I am not satisfied this was caused by the tenant through ordinary 
use of a toilet. This claim is dismissed.
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
16. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
17. Tenants are liable for the cost of repairing damage that is intentional or which 
results from any activity at the premises that is an imprisonable offence.  This 
applies to anything the tenant does and anything done by a person they are 
responsible for.  See section 49B(1) RTA.
18. Damage is intentional where a person intends to cause damage and takes the 
necessary steps to achieve that purpose.  Damage is also intentional where a 
person does something, or allows a situation to continue, knowing that damage 
is a certainty.  See Guo v Korck [2019] NZHC 1541.
19. The following damage was caused during the tenancy: damage to 2 windows, 
walls in the 3 bedrooms, lounge and passageway. The agent showed pictures 
of a number of holes on the walls, glue on the master bedroom, strong marks 
on the walls. 
20. The pre-inspection photos show an older tidy house. 
21. The agent says 2 windows had to be repaired and provided an invoice, photos 
pre-inspection and post inspection. The amount of $334.88 is awarded for this 
repair.
22. The agent says the walls and ceiling had been repainted before this tenant 
moved in. The doors, frames and skirting were aged and not painted. These 
appear to have been of a lower standard. 23. The photos showing the damage to the walls in the bedrooms, lounge and 
passage way is more than fair wear and tear, and the tenant has not disproved 
liability for the damage.
24. The agent proved the Tribunal with 2 quotes they had been provided to repair 
the damage. The agent also provided an invoice which included an entire 
repaint of the house. Considering the information and after hearing from the 
agent provided, the Tribunal awards $4500.00 towards the repairs. 
25. I have taken into account betterment and depreciation.  The landlord should be 
returned to the position they would have been in had the tenant not breached 
their obligations, and should not be better or worse off.  In calculating 
depreciation, I have taken into account the age and condition of the items at the 
start of the tenancy and their likely useful lifespan.   
26. Because Rentout Limited As Agent For Lakshmi Narayanan Srinivasan has 
substantially succeeded with the claim I have reimbursed the filing fee.

of hearing mr choudry had not put the house on the market for sale mr did not in fact rent the property to a single tenant after mr vacated had he done so it is arguable whether this action would have made the termination unlawful the intent and purpose of permitting the landlord to terminate a tenancy if they intend to sell the premise is to allow the landlord to market the property when it is unoccupied and to sell it with vacant possession from that perspective allowing the landlord to re rent the premise after terminating a tenancy on the basis of putting the property on the market for sale seems contrary to the spirit and intent of this provision however it is not contrary to the actual word of the section section a rta state that a landlord may terminate a periodic tenancy by notice if the premise are to be put on the market for sale within of the end of the tenancy there is no specific requirement that the property remain untenanted after the termination until the sale mr s argument that mr choudry s proposed action would amount to discrimination on the basis of family status is tenable discrimination is an unlawful act under section of the residential tenancy act and exemplary damage of can apply given that mr did not replace with a single tenant there is no basis for me to consider an award of exemplary damage in this instance a noted above part of the requirement for termination under section a is that the landlord put the property on the market within of the termination of the tenancy that ha not happened in this instance mr submitted that after

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - Whangarei | Whangārei-terenga-parāoa
APPLICANT: Shamrose Chaudhry
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: Mike Henwood
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: 5 Ashley Avenue, Raumanga, Whangarei 0110
ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision. 
2.  Mike Henwood is to pay Shamrose Chaudhry $58.00 from the bond, calculated 
as shown in table below. 
3. The Bond Centre is to pay the bond of $1,860.00 (5708464-002) immediately 
apportioned as follows:
Shamrose Chaudhry: $58.00
Mike Henwood: $1,802.00
Description Landlord Tenant
Key replacement $33.00  
Cleaning: Carport and garage $25.00  
Total award $58.00  
Bond $58.00 $1,802.00Reasons:
Background 
1. The tenancy ended on 12 June 2023.
2. The landlord’s application seeks:
a. Compensation for cleaning ($97.70) and then replacing ($358.00) the hob.
b. Cost of a replacement key ($33.00).
c. Cleaning costs ($25.00).

($288.57).
e. Compensation for costs associated for landlord dealing with end of tenancy 
issues and filing this application ($782.00).
3. The tenant’s application seeks refund of the bond and raises an issue with

4. The hearing took place in Whangarei on 15 September 2023.  Both parties 
attended the hearing.
Landlord application 
Hob
5. Mr Chaudry submitted that the hob elements were badly rusted at the end of the 
tenancy.  He attempted to clean the hob and he applied a rust treatment 
product.
6. The cleaning removed some of the surface rust, but it also revealed deep pitting 
on the elements.  The damage cannot be repaired, and it affected the 
functioning of the hob.
7. Mr Chaudry submitted that the hob had very little use and was in good condition 
at the beginning of Mr Henwood’s tenancy in January 2021.  The IRD’s 
depreciation guidelines state that an average expected lifespan of a hob is eight 
years.  Mr Chaudry submitted that the fact that this hob needed to be replaced 
after two years shows that Mr Henwood treated it carelessly, either leaving wet 
items on the elements or failing to clean up spills.  
8. Mr Chaudry’s claim seeks cleaning costs and the cost of purchasing and 
installing a new hob.
9. Mr Henwood submitted that:
a. The hob elements were already showing signs of deterioration at the 
beginning of the tenancy.  Mr Henwood provided a photograph in support 
of this.b. The hob is a Bellini brand that can be purchased at Bunnings for 
approximately $200.  These hobs have a short lifespan and are particularly 
susceptible to rusting elements.  In support of this, Mr Henwood provided:
i. An email from Mr Whitehead, a Service Manager with Laser 
Electrical, who states:
It is common for this style of hob to rust after only a short time.
These cheaper cooktops are more suited to a holiday home, 
beach house etc that is only used a few times a year.
The more expensive brands are made using better steel in the 
hotplates which should last a lot longer than their cheaper 
counterparts although hotplates do not last as long as a ceramic 
top or quality gas cooktop would.
ii. Two one-star product reviews of the Bellini hob from the Bunnings 
website.  One reviewer, Kay, succinctly describes the product as 
“Rubbish” and states:
This product is not fit for purpose. Elements rusted on first use, 
the stainless steel is so thin it gets very hot to touch and spills 
bake on and cannot be cleaned. 
The other one-star review also notes that the elements rusted 
quickly and extensively. 
10. I note that there are now a total of five ratings of this product on the Bunnings 
website, two one-star, two two-star and one four-star.  One of the two-star 
reviews also states “rusts very quickly”.
11. The evidence provided by Mr Henwood is sufficient to rebut the inference that 
the rapid deterioration of the elements is due to some careless action by Mr 
Henwood rather than normal wear and tear for this particular make and model.
12. This part of the landlord’s claim is dismissed.
Key
13. At the end of the tenancy Mr Henwood was missing two keys.  He had a 
conversation with Mr Choudry about this.  Mr Henwood said that he would look 
for the keys.  Mr Choudry said that was fine, and if Mr Henwood could not find 
them then he would simply cut more keys.
14. Mr Henwood found one key but not the other.
15. The claim seeks the cost of cutting a new key ($8.00) plus the landlord’s time 
and travel ($25.00)
16. Mr Henwood submitted that the landlord has insurance for replacement of keys 
or locks with a nil excess.17. A tenant’s liability for careless damage to the property is limited to the amount 
of the landlord’s insurance excess or the equivalent of four weeks’ rent, 
whichever is the lesser1.
18. Mr Henwood’s argument is that this principle also applies to his liability for 
replacing the missing key.
19. My finding is that the limitation does not apply.
20. The section in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 that sets out the limitation is 
within a part of the Act entitled “Responsibility for damage”.  That part includes 
sections 49A – 49E.  
21. Per section 49B, the limitation applies to the tenant’s liability for “destruction of, 
or damage to the premises that is caused by a careless act or omission of the 
tenant”.
22. The tenant’s obligation to return all keys at the end of the tenancy is in a 
different part of the Act2.  A tenant’s failure to return the keys does not amount 
to destruction of, or damage to the premises.
23. The limitation of liability does not apply.
24. Even though Mr Choudry holds insurance with a nil excess, he is not obliged to 
make an insurance claim.  Mr Henwood is liable for the proven and reasonable 
costs of replacing the key.
25. The amount claimed by Mr Choudray is fair and reasonable.  Mr Choudray is 
entitled to be compensated for his time in addition to the actual cost of cutting a 
new key.
Cleaning
26. Tenants must leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy at the end of the 
tenancy.
27. The claim seeks $25.00 (representing half an hour of cleaning) to sweep out the 
carport and to remove a few piles of dirt / dust that the tenant had left in the 
garage.
28. Overall, the premises were left in a reasonably clean and tidy condition, but Mr 
Choudry’s photographs show that these two areas were overlooked, and the 
claim is fair and reasonable.
Power turned off at the end of the tenancy29. Mr Henwood had the power disconnected on the last day of the tenancy and re-
connected to his new property.
30. When Mr Choudry attempted to get power re-established via his own power 
company, he was not able to do so.
31. After several frustrating phone calls over a period of several days, Mr Choudry 
discovered that the main power switch at the property had been switched off.
32. Mr Choudry seeks compensation for his time and inconvenience.
33. Mr Henwood submitted that it is normal to switch off the mains power when 
leaving a property.  In this instance he did not switch off the power, it was most 
likely done by one of his friends who were helping him move out.  Mr Henwood 
submitted that the power went off around midday, which is when he asked his 
power company to disconnect the power.  He was not aware that one of his 
helpers had turned off the main switch.
34. I acknowledge that Mr Choudry did incur inconvenience and delay because of 
this issue.  However, Mr Henwood has not done anything that amounts to a 
breach of his legal duty as a tenant.  
35. There is no legal basis to hold Mr Henwood liable for this cost, and this part of 
the landlord’s application must be dismissed.
Compensation for general inconvenience
36. The claim seeks compensation for time and inconvenience relating to “the 
tenant not doing their duty per the tenancy contract and leaving the mess for the 
landlord to sort, including filing this application and writing all this explanation, 
even dealing with multiple texts, abusive messages and blackmail attempts”.
37. This part of Mr Choudry’s application is dismissed for the following reasons:
a. The Tenancy Tribunal has no power to award costs to any party except in 
certain limited circumstances, none of which apply in this instance3.
b. The proven claim against Mr Henwood is very minor.
c. Communicating with a tenant and dealing with end of tenancy issues is 
part of a landlord’s normal business and the landlord cannot have any 
reasonable expectation of being compensated for that activity above and 
beyond the rent.
Tenant application38. Mr Choudry gave Mr Henwood notice to terminate the tenancy on the grounds 
that he was going to put the property on the market for sale.
39. Mr Henwood submitted that he had a conversation with Mr Choudry sometime 
after Mr Choudry gave notice, and in that conversation Mr Choudry said that he 
intended to put a single tenant into the property and then sell the property with 
that person as a sitting tenant.
40. Mr Henwood submitted that this:
a. Renders the termination unlawful and invalid; and
b. Amounts to discrimination on the basis of family status, which is a 
prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Human Rights Act 1993.
41. Mr Henwood noted that, as at the date of hearing, Mr Choudry had not put the 
house on the market for sale.
42. Mr Choudry did not in fact rent the property to a single tenant after Mr Henwood 
vacated.   
43. Had he done so, it is arguable whether this action would have made the 
termination unlawful.  The intent and purpose of permitting the landlord to 
terminate a tenancy if they intend to sell the premises is to allow the landlord to 
market the property when it is unoccupied and to sell it with vacant possession.  
From that perspective, allowing the landlord to re-rent the premises after 
terminating a tenancy on the basis of putting the property on the market for sale 
seems contrary to the spirit and intent of this provision.
44. However, it is not contrary to the actual words of the section.  Section 51(2)(a) 
RTA states that a landlord may terminate a periodic tenancy by 90-days’ notice 
if the premises are to be put on the market for sale within 90-days of the end of 
the tenancy.  There is no specific requirement that the property remain 
untenanted after the termination until the sale.
45. Mr Henwood’s argument that Mr Choudry’s proposed action would amount to 
discrimination on the basis of family status is tenable.  Discrimination is an 
unlawful act under section 12 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 and 
exemplary damages of up to $6,500 can apply.  Given that Mr Choudry did not 
replace Mr Henwood with a single tenant, there is no basis for me to consider 
an award of exemplary damages in this instance.
46. As noted above, part of the requirement for termination under section 51(2)(a) is 
that the landlord put the property on the market within 90-days of the 
termination of the tenancy.
47. That has not happened in this instance.
48. Mr Choudry submitted that after Mr Henwood vacated, he discovered that parts 
of the property required repairs and maintenance.  He discussed with his real estate agent whether he would be better to carry out the repairs and then 
market the house, or sell it “as is”.  After some consideration, he decided to 
carry out the repairs.  This has delayed the house going onto the market.
49. I accept that when Mr Choudry gave the notice, he intended to put the property 
on the market within 90-days of the end of the tenancy.  I accept that Mr 
Choudry still intends to sell the property, and the delay is due to information that 
only came to light at the end of the tenancy.  
50. I am satisfied that the termination was lawful.
Outcome
51. Both parties will bear their own cost of the filing fee.
52. Mr Choudry will receive $58.00 from the bond.
53. The balance of the bond will be released to Mr Henwood.

Landlord application 
Hob
5. Mr Chaudry submitted that the hob elements were badly rusted at the end of the 
tenancy.  He attempted to clean the hob and he applied a rust treatment 
product.
6. The cleaning removed some of the surface rust, but it also revealed deep pitting 
on the elements.  The damage cannot be repaired, and it affected the 
functioning of the hob.
7. Mr Chaudry submitted that the hob had very little use and was in good condition 
at the beginning of Mr Henwood’s tenancy in January 2021.  The IRD’s 
depreciation guidelines state that an average expected lifespan of a hob is eight 
years.  Mr Chaudry submitted that the fact that this hob needed to be replaced 
after two years shows that Mr Henwood treated it carelessly, either leaving wet 
items on the elements or failing to clean up spills.  
8. Mr Chaudry’s claim seeks cleaning costs and the cost of purchasing and 
installing a new hob.
9. Mr Henwood submitted that:
a. The hob elements were already showing signs of deterioration at the 
beginning of the tenancy.  Mr Henwood provided a photograph in support 
of this.b. The hob is a Bellini brand that can be purchased at Bunnings for 
approximately $200.  These hobs have a short lifespan and are particularly 
susceptible to rusting elements.  In support of this, Mr Henwood provided:
i. An email from Mr Whitehead, a Service Manager with Laser 
Electrical, who states:
It is common for this style of hob to rust after only a short time.
These cheaper cooktops are more suited to a holiday home, 
beach house etc that is only used a few times a year.
The more expensive brands are made using better steel in the 
hotplates which should last a lot longer than their cheaper 
counterparts although hotplates do not last as long as a ceramic 
top or quality gas cooktop would.
ii. Two one-star product reviews of the Bellini hob from the Bunnings 
website.  One reviewer, Kay, succinctly describes the product as 
“Rubbish” and states:
This product is not fit for purpose. Elements rusted on first use, 
the stainless steel is so thin it gets very hot to touch and spills 
bake on and cannot be cleaned. 
The other one-star review also notes that the elements rusted 
quickly and extensively. 
10. I note that there are now a total of five ratings of this product on the Bunnings 
website, two one-star, two two-star and one four-star.  One of the two-star 
reviews also states “rusts very quickly”.
11. The evidence provided by Mr Henwood is sufficient to rebut the inference that 
the rapid deterioration of the elements is due to some careless action by Mr 
Henwood rather than normal wear and tear for this particular make and model.
12. This part of the landlord’s claim is dismissed.
Key
13. At the end of the tenancy Mr Henwood was missing two keys.  He had a 
conversation with Mr Choudry about this.  Mr Henwood said that he would look 
for the keys.  Mr Choudry said that was fine, and if Mr Henwood could not find 
them then he would simply cut more keys.
14. Mr Henwood found one key but not the other.
15. The claim seeks the cost of cutting a new key ($8.00) plus the landlord’s time 
and travel ($25.00)
16. Mr Henwood submitted that the landlord has insurance for replacement of keys 
or locks with a nil excess.17. A tenant’s liability for careless damage to the property is limited to the amount 
of the landlord’s insurance excess or the equivalent of four weeks’ rent, 
whichever is the lesser1.
18. Mr Henwood’s argument is that this principle also applies to his liability for 
replacing the missing key.
19. My finding is that the limitation does not apply.
20. The section in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 that sets out the limitation is 
within a part of the Act entitled “Responsibility for damage”.  That part includes 
sections 49A – 49E.  
21. Per section 49B, the limitation applies to the tenant’s liability for “destruction of, 
or damage to the premises that is caused by a careless act or omission of the 
tenant”.
22. The tenant’s obligation to return all keys at the end of the tenancy is in a 
different part of the Act2.  A tenant’s failure to return the keys does not amount 
to destruction of, or damage to the premises.
23. The limitation of liability does not apply.
24. Even though Mr Choudry holds insurance with a nil excess, he is not obliged to 
make an insurance claim.  Mr Henwood is liable for the proven and reasonable 
costs of replacing the key.
25. The amount claimed by Mr Choudray is fair and reasonable.  Mr Choudray is 
entitled to be compensated for his time in addition to the actual cost of cutting a 
new key.
Cleaning
26. Tenants must leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy at the end of the 
tenancy.
27. The claim seeks $25.00 (representing half an hour of cleaning) to sweep out the 
carport and to remove a few piles of dirt / dust that the tenant had left in the 
garage.
28. Overall, the premises were left in a reasonably clean and tidy condition, but Mr 
Choudry’s photographs show that these two areas were overlooked, and the 
claim is fair and reasonable.
Power turned off at the end of the tenancy29. Mr Henwood had the power disconnected on the last day of the tenancy and re-
connected to his new property.
30. When Mr Choudry attempted to get power re-established via his own power 
company, he was not able to do so.
31. After several frustrating phone calls over a period of several days, Mr Choudry 
discovered that the main power switch at the property had been switched off.
32. Mr Choudry seeks compensation for his time and inconvenience.
33. Mr Henwood submitted that it is normal to switch off the mains power when 
leaving a property.  In this instance he did not switch off the power, it was most 
likely done by one of his friends who were helping him move out.  Mr Henwood 
submitted that the power went off around midday, which is when he asked his 
power company to disconnect the power.  He was not aware that one of his 
helpers had turned off the main switch.
34. I acknowledge that Mr Choudry did incur inconvenience and delay because of 
this issue.  However, Mr Henwood has not done anything that amounts to a 
breach of his legal duty as a tenant.  
35. There is no legal basis to hold Mr Henwood liable for this cost, and this part of 
the landlord’s application must be dismissed.
Compensation for general inconvenience
36. The claim seeks compensation for time and inconvenience relating to “the 
tenant not doing their duty per the tenancy contract and leaving the mess for the 
landlord to sort, including filing this application and writing all this explanation, 
even dealing with multiple texts, abusive messages and blackmail attempts”.
37. This part of Mr Choudry’s application is dismissed for the following reasons:
a. The Tenancy Tribunal has no power to award costs to any party except in 
certain limited circumstances, none of which apply in this instance3.
b. The proven claim against Mr Henwood is very minor.
c. Communicating with a tenant and dealing with end of tenancy issues is 
part of a landlord’s normal business and the landlord cannot have any 
reasonable expectation of being compensated for that activity above and 
beyond the rent.
Tenant application38. Mr Choudry gave Mr Henwood notice to terminate the tenancy on the grounds 
that he was going to put the property on the market for sale.
39. Mr Henwood submitted that he had a conversation with Mr Choudry sometime 
after Mr Choudry gave notice, and in that conversation Mr Choudry said that he 
intended to put a single tenant into the property and then sell the property with 
that person as a sitting tenant.
40. Mr Henwood submitted that this:
a. Renders the termination unlawful and invalid; and
b. Amounts to discrimination on the basis of family status, which is a 
prohibited grounds of discrimination under the Human Rights Act 1993.
41. Mr Henwood noted that, as at the date of hearing, Mr Choudry had not put the 
house on the market for sale.
42. Mr Choudry did not in fact rent the property to a single tenant after Mr Henwood 
vacated.   
43. Had he done so, it is arguable whether this action would have made the 
termination unlawful.  The intent and purpose of permitting the landlord to 
terminate a tenancy if they intend to sell the premises is to allow the landlord to 
market the property when it is unoccupied and to sell it with vacant possession.  
From that perspective, allowing the landlord to re-rent the premises after 
terminating a tenancy on the basis of putting the property on the market for sale 
seems contrary to the spirit and intent of this provision.
44. However, it is not contrary to the actual words of the section.  Section 51(2)(a) 
RTA states that a landlord may terminate a periodic tenancy by 90-days’ notice 
if the premises are to be put on the market for sale within 90-days of the end of 
the tenancy.  There is no specific requirement that the property remain 
untenanted after the termination until the sale.
45. Mr Henwood’s argument that Mr Choudry’s proposed action would amount to 
discrimination on the basis of family status is tenable.  Discrimination is an 
unlawful act under section 12 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 and 
exemplary damages of up to $6,500 can apply.  Given that Mr Choudry did not 
replace Mr Henwood with a single tenant, there is no basis for me to consider 
an award of exemplary damages in this instance.
46. As noted above, part of the requirement for termination under section 51(2)(a) is 
that the landlord put the property on the market within 90-days of the 
termination of the tenancy.
47. That has not happened in this instance.
48. Mr Choudry submitted that after Mr Henwood vacated, he discovered that parts 
of the property required repairs and maintenance.  He discussed with his real estate agent whether he would be better to carry out the repairs and then 
market the house, or sell it “as is”.  After some consideration, he decided to 
carry out the repairs.  This has delayed the house going onto the market.
49. I accept that when Mr Choudry gave the notice, he intended to put the property 
on the market within 90-days of the end of the tenancy.  I accept that Mr 
Choudry still intends to sell the property, and the delay is due to information that 
only came to light at the end of the tenancy.  
50. I am satisfied that the termination was lawful.
Outcome
51. Both parties will bear their own cost of the filing fee.
52. Mr Choudry will receive $58.00 from the bond.
53. The balance of the bond will be released to Mr Henwood.

24. Even though Mr Choudry holds insurance with a nil excess, he is not obliged to 
make an insurance claim.  Mr Henwood is liable for the proven and reasonable 
costs of replacing the key.
25. The amount claimed by Mr Choudray is fair and reasonable.  Mr Choudray is 
entitled to be compensated for his time in addition to the actual cost of cutting a 
new key.
Cleaning
26. Tenants must leave the premises reasonably clean and tidy at the end of the

36. The claim seeks compensation for time and inconvenience relating to “the

even dealing with multiple texts, abusive messages and blackmail attempts”.

discrimination on the basis of family status is tenable.  Discrimination is an 
unlawful act under section 12 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 and 
exemplary damages of up to $6,500 can apply.  Given that Mr Choudry did not 
replace Mr Henwood with a single tenant, there is no basis for me to consider 
an award of exemplary damages in this instance.
46. As noted above, part of the requirement for termination under section 51(2)(a) is 
that the landlord put the property on the market within 90-days of the 
termination of the tenancy.

53. The balance of the bond will be released to Mr Henwood.

ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision. 
2.  William Andrew Nurse to pay Patricia Quinn and Denis Quinn $806.24 from the 
bond, calculated as shown in table below. 
Description Landlord Tenant
Cleaning: Curtains $285.80  
Lawns and Garden work $200.00  
Repairs: Flooring $300.00  
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44  
Total award $806.24  
Bond $806.24 $243.76
3. The Bond Centre is to pay the bond of $1,050.00 (3358501-006) immediately 
apportioned as follows:
Patricia Quinn and Denis Quinn: $806.24
William Andrew Nurse: $243.76
Reasons:
1. Both parties attended the hearing.2. The landlord has applied for compensation, refund of the bond, and 
reimbursement of the filing fee following the end of the tenancy.
Did the tenant comply with their obligations at the end of the tenancy?
3. At the end of the tenancy the tenant must leave the premises reasonably clean 
and tidy, remove all rubbish, return all keys and security devices, and leave all 
chattels provided for their benefit.  See section 40(1)(e)(ii)-(v) Residential 
Tenancies Act 1986.  
4. The landlord claimed that the tenant did not leave the gardens in the condition 
they were in at the start of the tenancy.  The photographs show the garden to 
be extremely well presented at the start of the tenancy.   The landlord claims 
that the tenant agreed to maintain the gardens to that standard.  The Act 
requires the tenant to leave the gardens reasonably clean and tidy.  The RTA 
applies despite a provision to the contrary in a tenancy agreement – see s11 
RTA.
5. The photographs show that the gardens at the end of the tenancy were 
generally tidy with some areas requiring additional weeding.  I award the 
landlord $200 of the $480.00 claimed.
6. In relation to the paths and water blasting.  The condition at the end of the 
tenancy was consistent with winter outdoor conditions and the cleaning required 
is a landlord maintenance obligation.
7. A set of curtains had to be dry cleaned and Mr Nurse agreed to meet that cost 
of $285.80.
Is the tenant responsible for the damage to the premises?
8. A landlord must prove that damage to the premises occurred during the tenancy 
and is more than fair wear and tear. If this is established, to avoid liability, the 
tenant must prove they did not carelessly or intentionally cause or permit the 
damage.  Tenants are liable for the actions of people at the premises with their 
permission.  See sections 40(2)(a), 41 and 49B RTA.
9. The landlord claims that the polyurethane surface to the timber floor was 
damaged during the tenancy.  The landlord claims $1,725.00 for repairs but has 
not carried out the work.
10. The photographs show that an area of the floor surface was damaged by 
castors from a chair during the tenancy.  This damage is more extensive than 
the wear and tear that can be expected from everyday use.  The evidence also 
established that Mr Nurse became aware that the particular chair was causing 
degradation or damage to the flooring at some point during the tenancy but did not take any steps to prevent further damage until asked to do so by the 
landlord.
11. I find that, at least some of, the damage to the polyurethane surface was 
carelessly caused during this tenancy.  However, the coating is at least 9 years 
old.  It does not have an infinite life.  Other areas of the floor remain in good 
condition while some, particularly around the dining table, are more worn.  The 
landlord has not yet had the floor recoated so has not incurred any cost.
12. I have considered betterment and depreciation.  In calculating depreciation, I 
have considered the age and condition of the items at the start of the tenancy 
and their likely useful lifespan.   I award $300 of the $1,725.00 claimed for floor 
damage, recognising the reduction in the surface’s likely lifespan.
13. As the landlord was partially successful, I have awarded reimbursement of the 
Tribunal application fee.

2. The landlord has applied for rent arrears, compensation, refund of the bond, 
and reimbursement of the filing fee following the end of the tenancy.
3. The landlord withdrew the application for rent arrears ($85.71).
4. The tenant accepted the landlord’s claims for cleaning and carpet cleaning. I 
have allowed those claims by consent.
5. After hearing the tenants’ evidence, the landlord reduced the claim for rubbish 
removal. I have awarded the reduced amount based on the photographic 
evidence produced and the tenants’ acknowledgment that they did not remove 
all their rubbish.
The tenants’ application
6. The tenants have applied for compensation for alleged breaches by the owner 
of the premises in relation to the sleepout and the caravan at the premises.
7. The tenants seek compensation because they say a caravan was provided as 
part of the tenancy but was unliveable, and the sleepout was unconsented and 
therefore unlawful for use.
8. The tenancy started on 2 May 2022. The tenancy agreement is between the 
owner of the premises and the tenants.9. The owner’s agent Gold Property Management Ltd (GPML) only became the 
landlord on 9 June 2022. Mr Christiansen gave evidence that the old caravan 
on site was not included in the tenancy agreement nor was it part of the 
management agreement between the owner and her agent.
10. Generally, an agent is not liable in law for the actions of its principle. So, GPML 
is not liable for any alleged breaches by the owner who was the landlord when 
the tenancy started.
11. The tenants’ claims in relation to the caravan and the sleepout date to the 
commencement of the tenancy. If the sleepout was unlawful then, the claim 
must be made against the landlord at the time – the owner.
12. The tenants can pursue a claim against the owner of the premises for breaches 
that they allege occurred at the start of the tenancy, but not against GPML.
13. I have therefore dismissed the tenants’ application against GPML.
14. On the landlord’s successful application I have reimbursed the Tribunal filing 
fee.
Name suppression
15. The landlord did not seek a name suppression order.
16. The tenants sought name suppression. They are not entitled to a name 
suppression order because their application is unsuccessful, and they accepted 
most of the landlord’s claims – see section 95A Residential Tenancies Act

on site was not included in the tenancy agreement nor was it part of the 
management agreement between the owner and her agent.
10. Generally, an agent is not liable in law for the actions of its principle. So, GPML 
is not liable for any alleged breaches by the owner who was the landlord when 
the tenancy started.
11. The tenants’ claims in relation to the caravan and the sleepout date to the 
commencement of the tenancy. If the sleepout was unlawful then, the claim 
must be made against the landlord at the time – the owner.
12. The tenants can pursue a claim against the owner of the premises for breaches 
that they allege occurred at the start of the tenancy, but not against GPML.
13. I have therefore dismissed the tenants’ application against GPML.
14. On the landlord’s successful application I have reimbursed the Tribunal filing 
fee.
Name suppression
15. The landlord did not seek a name suppression order.
16. The tenants sought name suppression. They are not entitled to a name 
suppression order because their application is unsuccessful, and they accepted 
most of the landlord’s claims – see section 95A Residential Tenancies Act 
1986.

2. The landlord has applied for rent and water arrears and termination of the 
tenancy for breach of the tenant’s obligations.
3. The landlord provided invoices for water usage which confirm the amount 
outstanding. Having sighted these invoices I am satisfied that the tenant is 
responsible for payment of this overdue amount.
Should the tenancy be terminated?
4. The Tribunal may terminate a tenancy for breach where, due to the nature or 
extent of the breach, it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate.  See section 
56(1) Residential Tenancies Act 1986.  
5. Where the breach is capable of remedy the landlord must first serve a notice on 
the tenant requiring them to remedy the breach within at least 14 days and

despite numerous requests. The tenant has also failed to pay the bond. I have 
sighted numerous email exchanges between the parties where the tenant 
advises that the rent will be paid. On each occasion there has been no rent 
received by the landlord.

prove the amount owing as at todays’ date.10. Because Barfoot & Thompson Limited As Agent For Daniel Reid- Watson has

Reasons:
1. The landlord attended the hearing by teleconference. The Tribunal made three 
attempts to call the tenant on the cell phone number provided in the application,

of the hearing but did not attend.
2. The landlord has applied for termination of the tenancy for breach of the

3. The Tribunal may terminate a tenancy for breach where, due to the nature or

5. The tenant has breached their obligations by failing to pay rent when it is due. 
There are several instances of the tenant falling into arrears in January, and 
February 2023 and more recently, continuous arrears since June 2023.
6. The landlord has served several 14-day notices on the tenant. In relation to the 
notices dated 8 June 2023 and 8 August 2023 the tenant did not remedy the 
breaches within the required period. Furthermore, the tenant was more than 21 
days in arrears as at 8 September 2023. The tenant is still in arrears at the 
hearing date. 
7. I am satisfied on the evidence that it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate 
the tenancy because there is a pattern of the tenant failing to pay rent on time 
and failing to remedy the rent arrears as required in the 14 day notices served 
on the tenant. 
8. The tenancy is therefore terminated. The landlord provided evidence of 
discussions with the tenant agreeing to termination of the tenancy on 17 
October 2023. As requested by the landlord the tenancy is terminated with 
effect on that date.
9. The landlord provided rent records which prove the amount owing at the

the tenancy terminates.

tenant’s obligations.Should the tenancy be terminated?
3. The Tribunal may terminate a tenancy for breach where, due to the nature or 
extent of the breach, it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate.  See section 
56(1) Residential Tenancies Act 1986.  
4. Where the breach is capable of remedy the landlord must first serve a notice on 
the tenant requiring them to remedy the breach within at least 14 days and 
establish that the tenant has failed to do so.
5. The tenant has breached their obligations by failing to pay rent when it is due. 
There are several instances of the tenant falling into arrears in January, and 
February 2023 and more recently, continuous arrears since June 2023.
6. The landlord has served several 14-day notices on the tenant. In relation to the 
notices dated 8 June 2023 and 8 August 2023 the tenant did not remedy the 
breaches within the required period. Furthermore, the tenant was more than 21 
days in arrears as at 8 September 2023. The tenant is still in arrears at the 
hearing date. 
7. I am satisfied on the evidence that it would be inequitable to refuse to terminate 
the tenancy because there is a pattern of the tenant failing to pay rent on time 
and failing to remedy the rent arrears as required in the 14 day notices served 
on the tenant. 
8. The tenancy is therefore terminated. The landlord provided evidence of 
discussions with the tenant agreeing to termination of the tenancy on 17 
October 2023. As requested by the landlord the tenancy is terminated with 
effect on that date.
9. The landlord provided rent records which prove the amount owing at the 
hearing date. I have calculated the arrears owed up to the end of the current 
rent period on Friday 29 September 2023. The tenant will be liable for 
continuing weekly rent of $500 next due on Saturday 30 September 2023 until 
the tenancy terminates. 
10. As the landlord has wholly succeeded with their application, they are entitled to 
suppression of their name and identifying details and to reimbursement of the 
filing fee.

ORDER
1. No application for suppression has been made in this case and no suppression 
orders apply around publication of this decision.
2. Cathryn Margaret O’Neill must, before Friday 27 October 2023, allow the 
landlord to enter the premises for the purposes of a property inspection before 
Friday 27 October 2023. The landlord must first give the tenant at least 48 
hours’ notice of the date and approximate time of the intended entry.
Reasons:
1. The landlord attended the hearing by teleconference represented by Ms Rea. 
The Tribunal attempted to contact the tenant on cell phone numbers provided 
for her in the application, but the cell phone numbers were either not active or 
the calls diverted to voicemail. 
2.  I also acknowledge that the tenant made a request for an adjournment of the 
hearing on grounds that she was ill and could not attend. She mentioned that 
this was due to the ongoing stress of this matter.  I declined to adjourn without 
the tenant providing a further explanation as to why she could not attend by 
telephone and a medical certificate, if possible. No further evidence of this 
nature was supplied.
3. I am satisfied that the tenant had notice of the hearing but chose not to attend.4. The landlord has applied for an order allowing them entry to the premises for 
the purposes of a property inspection to assess the premises for compliance 
with Healthy Homes Standards and general maintenance. 
5. Section 48(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) provides that the 
landlord may enter the premises for the purpose of carrying out necessary 
repairs or necessary maintenance or for inspecting the premises, after giving 
the tenant the required notice (at least 24 hours’ notice for repairs or 48 hours 
for inspections) or with the tenant’s consent given immediately before the time 
of entry. If the appropriate notice is given, the tenant’s consent to the access is 
not required. 
6. The landlord has attempted, after giving the appropriate notice, to conduct a 
property inspection on five occasions between March - May 2022. A visit did 
take place on 17 November 2022 but since then further attempts to visit and 
complete inspections, including an inspection visit arranged for 11 May 2023, 
have failed. The tenant has either rescheduled or refused access. This is a 
breach of her obligations in section 48(2) RTA (as set out above).
7. The tenant must allow the landlord access to complete the inspection within the 
next four weeks, that is before 27 October 2023, provided the landlord first 
gives the tenant the appropriate notice of the intended entry.
8. Failure by the tenant, without reasonable excuse, to allow the landlord access 
as permitted by section 48(2) is an unlawful act for which exemplary damages 
up to a maximum of $1,500.00 maybe payable. It is also a breach that, in 
certain circumstances, may entitle the landlord to an order terminating the 
tenancy.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - [Event location suppressed]
APPLICANT: [The applicant/s]
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: Daimon Mitchell
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: [Tenancy address suppressed]
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal orders 
suppression of the landlords name and identifying details.  No suppression orders apply 
to the tenant.
2. Daimon Mitchell must pay [The landlord/s] $2,683.70 immediately, calculated as shown 
in table below.
Description Landlord
Rent arrears $857.14
Water rates $43.17
Lock/key replacement $463.45
Cleaning and rubbish removal $1,299.50
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44
Total award $2,683.70
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $2,683.70
Reasons:
1. The Tribunal must consider an application filed by the landlord, and the relevant law 
that applies is found in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (“RTA”).
2. Only the landlord appeared at the hearing.  I am satisfied that the tenant has been 
property notified of the hearing, and therefore I will proceed to consider the claim in 
their absence.
3. The tenancy was terminated by order of the Tribunal on 7 February 2023.  The 
Tribunal also ordered the rent arrears and water due as of that date.  The landlord 
reports that there were delays in getting possession returned, with the possession 
returning on 22 February 2023.  4. The landlord seeks final orders from the Tribunal around final costs with the tenancy.
RENT ARREARS AND WATER RATES
5. The landlord has applied for an order that the tenant pay rent arrears and water rates 
between the earlier Tribunal order and possession returning.
6. As noted, the tenancy was terminated by order of the Tribunal.  Possession was to 
return to the landlord on 7 February 2023.  However there was a delay in the tenant 
returning possession of the tenancy, and I accept it was not returned to the landlord 
until 22 February 2023.  That is an additional 15 days of rent not paid following the 
earlier Tribunal rent arrears order.  I have confirmed the landlords calculation that the 
additional rent arrears to 22 February 2023 is $857.14, and that is ordered to be paid 
by the tenant.
7. The landlord has claimed for the final volumetric water charges of $43.17, that is 
ordered in full.
CLEANING AND RUBBISH REMOVAL
8. The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) requires that the landlord provide the 
premises to the tenant at the start of the tenancy in a reasonable state of cleanliness 
(s45(1)(a)), and there is an equivalent obligation on the tenant to return the premises:
…in a reasonably clean and reasonably tidy condition, and remove or 
arrange for the removal from the premises of all rubbish.  
9. It is important to note that the RTA does not require the premises to be provided / 
returned in an immaculate condition, only in a reasonably clean and tidy state.  There 
is no scientific way to determine what is ‘reasonably’ clean and tidy, what is required 
is for the Tribunal to evaluate the evidence available (particularly photographs 
presented), and then to determine whether the premises would be reasonably clean.  
10. The landlord seeks compensation for cleaning and rubbish removal.  The evidence is 
that the tenant left widespread rubbish and goods at the tenancy.  The landlord has 
claimed $1,299.50, with reference to the invoice from Wilson Property, who did the 
cleaning and rubbish removal.  I have reviewed the photographs taken by the 
landlord when possession was returned, and the costs claims would be 
commensurate with the work reasonably needed to return the premises to a state of 
being reasonably clean and tidy.  This claim is ordered in full.
COMPENSATION
11. With any claim for compensation, to receive an order the party must incur a loss.  In 
short the compensation is intended as best money can do, to compensate for the 
actual loss incurred.
12. In this case the landlord had claimed compensation for damage to the premises, but 
as discussed at the hearing today, I cannot make that order.  The landlord reports 
that there was some damage to the premises from the tenant, but after possession 
was returned, the house was broken into and at that time extensively damaged, to the point where the house now needs to be demolished.  The landlord did not incur any 
costs for the damage repairs from the tenant, so there was strictly no loss to 
compensate.  There was then an intervening action where the tenancy was effectively 
destroyed following possession returning to the landlord, but that is not damage that 
the tenant is liable for.
13. However the landlord seeks costs for lock and key replacement being a cost that was 
incurred.  The tenant did not return the keys so the landlord needed to replace locks.  
The RTA requires that at the end of the tenancy the tenant must return all keys.  
Failing to do so means the tenant is liable for the lock and key replacement.  The 
landlord has claimed $463.45 with reference to the locksmith invoice.  This is ordered 
in full. 
FILING FEE
14. Because the applicant has been wholly successful in their application, I must award 
the filing paid to commence the proceeding in the Tribunal, which is $20.44.
NAME SUPPRESSION
15. The Tribunal can order name suppression when a party has been wholly or 
substantially successful in the proceeding.  In this case the landlord has applied for 
name suppression which is ordered for the landlord only.

being reasonably clean and tidy.  This claim is ordered in full.
COMPENSATION
11. With any claim for compensation, to receive an order the party must incur a loss.  In 
short the compensation is intended as best money can do, to compensate for the 
actual loss incurred.
12. In this case the landlord had claimed compensation for damage to the premises, but 
as discussed at the hearing today, I cannot make that order.  The landlord reports 
that there was some damage to the premises from the tenant, but after possession 
was returned, the house was broken into and at that time extensively damaged, to the point where the house now needs to be demolished.  The landlord did not incur any 
costs for the damage repairs from the tenant, so there was strictly no loss to 
compensate.  There was then an intervening action where the tenancy was effectively 
destroyed following possession returning to the landlord, but that is not damage that 
the tenant is liable for.
13. However the landlord seeks costs for lock and key replacement being a cost that was 
incurred.  The tenant did not return the keys so the landlord needed to replace locks.  
The RTA requires that at the end of the tenancy the tenant must return all keys.  
Failing to do so means the tenant is liable for the lock and key replacement.  The 
landlord has claimed $463.45 with reference to the locksmith invoice.  This is ordered 
in full. 
FILING FEE
14. Because the applicant has been wholly successful in their application, I must award 
the filing paid to commence the proceeding in the Tribunal, which is $20.44.
NAME SUPPRESSION
15. The Tribunal can order name suppression when a party has been wholly or 
substantially successful in the proceeding.  In this case the landlord has applied for 
name suppression which is ordered for the landlord only.

TENANCY TRIBUNAL - [Event location suppressed]
APPLICANT: [The applicant/s]
Landlord 
RESPONDENT: Daimon Mitchell
Tenant 
TENANCY ADDRESS: [Tenancy address suppressed]
ORDER
1. An application for suppression has been made in this case, and the Tribunal orders 
suppression of the landlords name and identifying details.  No suppression orders apply 
to the tenant.
2. Daimon Mitchell must pay [The landlord/s] $2,683.70 immediately, calculated as shown 
in table below.
Description Landlord
Rent arrears $857.14
Water rates $43.17
Lock/key replacement $463.45
Cleaning and rubbish removal $1,299.50
Filing fee reimbursement $20.44
Total award $2,683.70
Total payable by Tenant to Landlord $2,683.70
Reasons:
1. The Tribunal must consider an application filed by the landlord, and the relevant law 
that applies is found in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (“RTA”).
2. Only the landlord appeared at the hearing.  I am satisfied that the tenant has been 
property notified of the hearing, and therefore I will proceed to consider the claim in 
their absence.
3. The tenancy was terminated by order of the Tribunal on 7 February 2023.  The 
Tribunal also ordered the rent arrears and water due as of that date.  The landlord 
reports that there were delays in getting possession returned, with the possession 
returning on 22 February 2023.  4. The landlord seeks final orders from the Tribunal around final costs with the tenancy.
RENT ARREARS AND WATER RATES
5. The landlord has applied for an order that the tenant pay rent arrears and water rates 
between the earlier Tribunal order and possession returning.
6. As noted, the tenancy was terminated by order of the Tribunal.  Possession was to 
return to the landlord on 7 February 2023.  However there was a delay in the tenant 
returning possession of the tenancy, and I accept it was not returned to the landlord 
until 22 February 2023.  That is an additional 15 days of rent not paid following the 
earlier Tribunal rent arrears order.  I have confirmed the landlords calculation that the 
additional rent arrears to 22 February 2023 is $857.14, and that is ordered to be paid 
by the tenant.
7. The landlord has claimed for the final volumetric water charges of $43.17, that is 
ordered in full.
CLEANING AND RUBBISH REMOVAL
8. The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA) requires that the landlord provide the 
premises to the tenant at the start of the tenancy in a reasonable state of cleanliness 
(s45(1)(a)), and there is an equivalent obligation on the tenant to return the premises:
…in a reasonably clean and reasonably tidy condition, and remove or 
arrange for the removal from the premises of all rubbish.  
9. It is important to note that the RTA does not require the premises to be provided / 
returned in an immaculate condition, only in a reasonably clean and tidy state.  There 
is no scientific way to determine what is ‘reasonably’ clean and tidy, what is required 
is for the Tribunal to evaluate the evidence available (particularly photographs 
presented), and then to determine whether the premises would be reasonably clean.  
10. The landlord seeks compensation for cleaning and rubbish removal.  The evidence is 
that the tenant left widespread rubbish and goods at the tenancy.  The landlord has 
claimed $1,299.50, with reference to the invoice from Wilson Property, who did the 
cleaning and rubbish removal.  I have reviewed the photographs taken by the 
landlord when possession was returned, and the costs claims would be 
commensurate with the work reasonably needed to return the premises to a state of 
being reasonably clean and tidy.  This claim is ordered in full.
COMPENSATION
11. With any claim for compensation, to receive an order the party must incur a loss.  In 
short the compensation is intended as best money can do, to compensate for the 
actual loss incurred.
12. In this case the landlord had claimed compensation for damage to the premises, but 
as discussed at the hearing today, I cannot make that order.  The landlord reports 
that there was some damage to the premises from the tenant, but after possession 
was returned, the house was broken into and at that time extensively damaged, to the point where the house now needs to be demolished.  The landlord did not incur any 
costs for the damage repairs from the tenant, so there was strictly no loss to 
compensate.  There was then an intervening action where the tenancy was effectively 
destroyed following possession returning to the landlord, but that is not damage that 
the tenant is liable for.
